	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> We have developed a method for intact mass analysis of detergent-solubilized and purified<lb/> integral membrane proteins using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) with<lb/> methanol as the organic mobile phase. Membrane proteins and detergents are separated<lb/> chromatographically during the isocratic stage of the gradient profile from a 150-mm C3 reversed-<lb/>phase column. The mass accuracy is comparable to standard methods employed for soluble<lb/> proteins; the sensitivity is 10-fold lower, requiring 0.2–5 μg of protein. The method is also<lb/> compatible with our standard LC–MS method used for intact mass analysis of soluble proteins and<lb/> may therefore be applied on a multiuser instrument or in a high-throughput environment.<lb/></div>

	<div type="introduction">Integral membrane proteins represent approximately 25% of the human proteome and are of<lb/> crucial biological importance in regulating the composition of the cell and the extracellular<lb/> environment, membrane potential, metabolism, cell structure, and signaling pathways. As a<lb/> result of their position as the gateway to cells, they are also the targets for many drugs, in<lb/> fact more than 50% of commercially available small molecule drugs target membrane<lb/> proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, transporters, other receptors, and<lb/> enzymes [1]. Despite the importance of membrane proteins in biology and pharmacology, to<lb/> date only 246 crystal structures exist for membrane proteins [2] in comparison to over<lb/> 50,000 for soluble proteins, and only 14 of those structures are of human integral membrane<lb/> Sponsored Document<lb/> Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.<lb/></div>
