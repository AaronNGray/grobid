	<div type="abstract">Incorporating new information into a knowledge base is an important problem which has been widely<lb/> investigated. In this paper, we study this problem in a formal framework for reasoning about actions<lb/> and change. In this framework, action domains are described in an action language whose semantics<lb/> is based on the notion of causality. Unlike the formalisms considered in the related work, this<lb/> language allows straightforward representation of non-deterministic effects and indirect effects of<lb/> (possibly concurrent) actions, as well as state constraints; therefore, the updates can be more general<lb/> than elementary statements. The expressivity of this formalism allows us to study the update of an<lb/> action domain description with a more general approach compared to related work. First of all, we<lb/> consider the update of an action description with respect to further criteria, for instance, by ensuring<lb/> that the updated description entails some observations, assertions, or general domain properties that<lb/> constitute further constraints that are not expressible in an action description in general. Moreover,<lb/> our framework allows us to discriminate amongst alternative updates of action domain descriptions<lb/> and to single out a most preferable one, based on a given preference relation possibly dependent on<lb/> the specified criteria. We study semantic and computational aspects of the update problem, and<lb/> establish basic properties of updates as well as a decomposition theorem that gives rise to a divide<lb/> and conquer approach to updating action descriptions under certain conditions. Furthermore, we<lb/> study the computational complexity of decision problems around computing solutions, both for the<lb/> generic setting and for two particular preference relations, viz. set-inclusion and weight-based<lb/> preference. While deciding the existence of solutions and recognizing solutions are PSPACE-<lb/>complete problems in general, the problems fall back into the polynomial hierarchy under restrictions<lb/> on the additional constraints. We finally discuss methods to compute solutions and approximate<lb/> solutions (which disregard preference). Our results provide a semantic and computational basis for<lb/> developing systems that incorporate new information into action domain descriptions in an action<lb/> language, in the presence of additional constraints.<lb/></div>
