	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACTa db_231 82..91<lb/> Recently, we demonstrated that the central ghrelin signalling system, involving the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1A), is<lb/> important for alcohol reinforcement. Ghrelin targets a key mesolimbic circuit involved in natural as well as drug-<lb/>induced reinforcement, that includes a dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus<lb/> accumbens. The aim of the present study was to determine whether it is possible to suppress ghrelin&apos;s effects on this<lb/> mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway can be suppressed, by interrupting afferent inputs to the VTA dopaminergic cells,<lb/> as shown previously for cholinergic afferents. Thus, the effects of pharmacological suppression of glutamatergic,<lb/> orexin A and opioid neurotransmitter systems on ghrelin-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system were<lb/> investigated. We found in the present study that ghrelin-induced locomotor stimulation was attenuated by VTA<lb/> administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist (AP5) but not by VTA administration of an orexin<lb/> A receptor antagonist (SB334867) or by peripheral administration of an opioid receptor antagonist (naltrexone).<lb/> Intra-VTA administration of AP5 also suppressed the ghrelin-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.<lb/> Finally the effects of peripheral ghrelin on locomotor stimulation and accumbal dopamine release were blocked by<lb/> intra-VTA administration of a GHS-R1A antagonist (BIM28163), indicating that GHS-R1A signalling within the VTA<lb/> is required for the ghrelin-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Given the clinical knowledge that<lb/> hyperghrelinemia is associated with addictive behaviours (such as compulsive overeating and alcohol use disorder) our<lb/> finding highlights a potential therapeutic strategy involving glutamatergic control of ghrelin action at the level of the<lb/> mesolimbic dopamine system.<lb/></div>
