	<div type="abstract">Background: The causal basis of the different patterns of language recovery following<lb/> stroke in bilingual speakers is not well understood. Our approach distinguishes the rep-<lb/>resentation of language from the mechanisms involved in its control. Previous studies<lb/> have suggested that difficulties in language control can explain selective aphasia in one<lb/> language as well as pathological switching between languages. Here we test the hypothe-<lb/>sis that difficulties in managing and resolving competition will also be observed in those<lb/> who are equally impaired in both their languages even in the absence of pathological<lb/> switching.<lb/> Aims: To examine difficulties in language control in bilingual individuals with parallel<lb/> recovery in aphasia and to compare their performance on different types of conflict<lb/> task.<lb/> Methods &amp; Procedures: Two right-handed, non-native English-speaking participants<lb/> who showed parallel recovery of two languages after stroke and a group of non-native<lb/> English-speaking, bilingual controls described a scene in English and in their first lan-<lb/>guage and completed three explicit conflict tasks. Two of these were verbal conflict<lb/> tasks: a lexical decision task in English, in which individuals distinguished English<lb/> words from non-words, and a Stroop task, in English and in their first language. The<lb/> third conflict task was a non-verbal flanker task.<lb/> Outcomes &amp; Results: Both participants with aphasia were impaired in the picture<lb/> description task in English and in their first language but showed different patterns of<lb/> impairment on the conflict tasks. For the participant with left subcortical damage, con-<lb/>flict was abnormally high during the verbal tasks (lexical decision and Stroop) but not<lb/> during the non-verbal flanker task. In contrast, for the participant with extensive left<lb/> parietal damage, conflict was less abnormal during the Stroop task than the flanker or<lb/> lexical decision task.<lb/> Conclusions: Our data reveal two distinct control impairments associated with parallel<lb/> recovery. We stress the need to explore the precise nature of control problems and how<lb/> control is implemented in order to develop fuller causal accounts of language recovery<lb/> patterns in bilingual aphasia.<lb/></div>
