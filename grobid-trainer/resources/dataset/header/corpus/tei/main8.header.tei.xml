	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Microneurography has been used in humans to study sympathetic activity supplying targets within<lb/> skeletal muscle and skin. Comparable animal studies are relatively few, probably due to the technical<lb/> demands of traditional fibre picking techniques. Here we apply a simple suction electrode technique<lb/> to record cutaneous (CVC) and muscle (MVC) vasoconstrictor activities and describe and investigate<lb/> the basis of the frequency dependence of lung inflation related modulation. Hindlimb MVC and CVC<lb/> activities were recorded concurrently. The magnitude of MVC and CVC activities at the lung inflation<lb/> cycle frequency was significantly less at 2.0 Hz than at lung inflation cycle frequencies ≤ 1.0 Hz. As<lb/> lung inflation cycle frequency was increased the coherence between lung inflation cycle or BP and<lb/> MVC or CVC waveforms decreased. Consistent with the hypothesis that much of the coherence<lb/> between lung inflation cycle and nerve activity waveforms is secondary to oscillating baroreceptor<lb/> activity attributable to BP waves, partialization with the BP waveform significantly decreased the<lb/> coherence between lung inflation cycle and nerve waveforms, and there was an absence of coherence<lb/> between these waveforms following sinus and aortic denervation. Our data extend findings from<lb/> other laboratories and establish the value of a suction electrode technique for recording MVC and<lb/> CVC activities. Furthermore, our observations describe the rates of positive pressure ventilation that<lb/> avoid strong and regular gating of sympathetic activity.<lb/> </div>
