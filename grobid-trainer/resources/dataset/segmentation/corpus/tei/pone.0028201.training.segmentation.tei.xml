			<front>Value of Laboratory Tests in Employer-Sponsored Health <lb/>Risk Assessments for Newly Identifying Health <lb/>Conditions: Analysis of 52,270 Participants <lb/>Harvey W. Kaufman*, Fred R. Williams, Mouneer A. Odeh <lb/>Quest Diagnostics, Madison, New Jersey, United States of America <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: Employer-sponsored health risk assessments (HRA) may include laboratory tests to provide evidence of <lb/>disease and disease risks for common medical conditions. We evaluated the ability of HRA-laboratory testing to provide new <lb/>disease-risk information to participants. <lb/>Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of HRA-laboratory results for participating adult <lb/>employees and their eligible spouses or their domestic partners, focusing on three common health conditions: <lb/>hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. HRA with laboratory results of 52,270 first-time participants <lb/>were analyzed. Nearly all participants had access to health insurance coverage. Twenty-four percent (12,392) self-reported <lb/>one or more of these medical conditions: 21.1% (11,017) self-identified as having hyperlipidemia, 4.7% (2,479) self-identified <lb/>as having diabetes, and 0.7% (352) self-identified as having chronic kidney disease. Overall, 36% (n = 18,540) of participants <lb/>had laboratory evidence of at least one medical condition newly identified: 30.7% (16,032) had laboratory evidence of <lb/>hyperlipidemia identified, 1.9% (984) had laboratory evidence of diabetes identified, and 5.5% (2,866) had laboratory <lb/>evidence of chronic kidney disease identified. Of all participants with evidence of hyperlipidemia 59% (16,030 of 27,047), <lb/>were newly identified through the HRA. Among those with evidence of diabetes 28% (984 of 3,463) were newly identified. <lb/>The highest rate of newly identified disease risk was for chronic kidney disease: 89% (2,866 of 3,218) of participants with <lb/>evidence of this condition had not self-reported it. Men (39%) were more likely than women (33%) to have at least one <lb/>newly identified condition (p,0.0001). Among men, lower levels of educational achievement were associated with <lb/>modestly higher rates of newly identified disease risk (p,0.0001); the association with educational achievement among <lb/>women was unclear. Even among the youngest age range (20 to 29 year olds), nearly 1 in 4 participants (24%) had a newly <lb/>identified risk for disease. <lb/>Conclusions/Significance: These results support the important role of employer-sponsored laboratory testing as an integral <lb/>element of HRA for identifying evidence of previously undiagnosed common medical conditions in individuals of all <lb/>working age ranges, regardless of educational level and gender. <lb/>Citation: Kaufman HW, Williams FR, Odeh MA (2011) Value of Laboratory Tests in Employer-Sponsored Health Risk Assessments for Newly Identifying Health <lb/>Conditions: Analysis of 52,270 Participants.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Employer-sponsored health risk assessments (HRA), a corner-<lb/>stone of wellness programs, are used to engage adults in taking <lb/>responsibility for their own health, provide feedback that will lead <lb/>to behavioral modifications that reduce disease risks, raise <lb/>productivity [1,2], and control healthcare expenses [3]. Simply <lb/>participating in HRA appears to have benefit [4,5]. HRA are now <lb/>being offered by more than 75% of mid-to large-sized companies <lb/>[6]. <lb/>HRA involve a health and lifestyle questionnaire and may <lb/>include biometric data (such as weight, body mass index (BMI), <lb/>waist circumference, and blood pressure) and laboratory test <lb/>results. The inclusion and selection of laboratory tests vary by <lb/>program. Self-reported results, even for widely known disease risk <lb/>factors such as total cholesterol, are often inaccurate [7]. When <lb/>measured laboratory tests are included in HRA, they are typically <lb/>limited to total cholesterol, lipid panel (total cholesterol, HDL <lb/>cholesterol, calculated LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) and <lb/>fasting glucose. It is less typical to include tests for other common <lb/>conditions, such as chronic kidney disease. <lb/>This study explores the utility of employer-sponsored laboratory <lb/>testing in revealing for new participants evidence of three common <lb/>medical conditions: hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic <lb/>kidney disease. These medical conditions were selected because of <lb/>their high prevalence in the United States population and the <lb/>benefit of effective intervention associated with early detection. <lb/>Cardiovascular disease is listed on more than half of all death <lb/>certificates [8], and diabetes [9] and chronic kidney disease [10] <lb/>are each estimated to affect approximately 26 million Americans. <lb/></body>

			<body>Current guidelines for &apos;&apos;normal-risk&apos;&apos; individuals suggest that <lb/>screening begin at age 40 years for cardiovascular disease [11], 45 <lb/>years for diabetes [12], and 60 years for chronic kidney disease <lb/>[13]. However, these diseases are growing in prevalence, even in <lb/>younger adults, and are often not diagnosed in a timely fashion <lb/>[14–15,16,17,18]. Early detection and treatment can delay or <lb/>arrest disease progression, and may help to avoid co-morbid <lb/>complications. The importance of screening for chronic kidney <lb/>disease in particular is often overlooked, increasing the likelihood <lb/>for associated kidney failure and cardiovascular events [13,19]. <lb/>The role and value of laboratory tests within employer-<lb/>sponsored HRA have not been well investigated. Among these <lb/>limited studies, none appears to have evaluated how often <lb/>common chronic diseases are newly identified among such <lb/>participants. We explore the frequency of results that are <lb/>consistent with increased disease risk and compare this with self-<lb/>reported information. This study uniquely focuses on the impact of <lb/>age, gender, and education level on the new identification of <lb/>common health conditions. Additionally, this study is the first to <lb/>assess the role of laboratory testing for chronic kidney disease as <lb/>part of an employer-sponsored HRA. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Study Population <lb/>This was a cross-sectional study of 52,270 first-time participants <lb/>ages 20 to 64 years using the Quest Diagnostics Blueprint for <lb/>WellnessH HRA. The program was sponsored by 15 employers <lb/>representing diverse industries between 2003 and 2010 with <lb/>participants from across the United States. To isolate the extent to <lb/>which laboratory testing provides new and medically relevant <lb/>health risk information, the study was limited to first-time <lb/>participants. Participants 65 years and older were excluded from <lb/>this study because of the relatively small number. The analysis in <lb/>this study was found to be exempt by the Western Institutional <lb/>Review Board for the protection of human subject research. <lb/>Participants included adult employees and their eligible spouses <lb/>or their domestic partners. All of the employers offered healthcare <lb/>insurance coverage to their eligible employees and covered family <lb/>members. <lb/>Evidence of Medical Conditions: Laboratory-Based and <lb/>Self-reported Awareness <lb/>Three common measurements of hyperlipidemia were used: <lb/>total cholesterol above 5.15 millimoles per liter (199 milligrams <lb/>per deciliter) [11], low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol above <lb/>3.35 millimoles per liter (129 milligrams per deciliter), and total <lb/>cholesterol to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio <lb/>above 5.0. Hyperlipidemia was identified if one or more of these <lb/>criteria were met. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus can be based on <lb/>fasting glucose levels or hemoglobin A1c levels. For this study, an <lb/>elevated fasting glucose level (greater than 6.90 millimoles per liter <lb/>(125 milligrams per deciliter)) was considered evidence of diabetes. <lb/>Kidney function was assessed with the estimated glomerular <lb/>filtration rate (eGFR), a calculation based on serum creatinine, <lb/>age, gender, and ethnicity (whether one is identified as African <lb/>American or non-African American). eGFR values below 60 mL/ <lb/>min/1.73 m <lb/>2 are indicative of chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5 <lb/>[13]. When ethnicity was not reported, eGFR was based on the <lb/>non-African American calculation. In a small percentage of <lb/>participants (estimated to be fewer than 75 out of 3,218 <lb/>participants with eGFR results below the threshold), this could <lb/>overstate the identification of new chronic kidney disease risk. This <lb/>estimate is based on taking all eGFR results between 50 and <lb/>59 ml/min/1.73 m <lb/>2 <lb/>, inclusive, for whom ethnicity was not <lb/>identified (n = 527) and multiplying by the percent of African-<lb/>Americans identified in the study population (14.0%). This <lb/>provided an estimate of the number of unidentified African <lb/>Americans who if they were so identified may have had a higher <lb/>eGFR based on the MDRD Study equation adjustment factor of <lb/>1.21 that applies only to African Americans. <lb/>As part of the HRA survey, participants were asked to report <lb/>whether they had been informed by a physician that they had any <lb/>of the medical conditions included in this study. For these <lb/>conditions, a comparison of self-reported disease awareness with <lb/>laboratory-based criteria provides an indication of new medical <lb/>risk information for each participant. Thus, a medical condition <lb/>was considered to be newly identified if it was not self-reported but <lb/>the relevant laboratory result(s) exceeded the threshold value. For <lb/>example, if a participant reported that he or she had not been <lb/>diagnosed with diabetes and the fasting glucose results showed <lb/>evidence of diabetes (fasting glucose .125 mg/dL), we classified <lb/>the participant as having newly identified diabetes. However, it is <lb/>important to note that laboratory results comprise only part of the <lb/>diagnostic pathway; further medical evaluation is required for <lb/>diagnosis. Furthermore, this methodology only provides a <lb/>snapshot of health risk and does not include health risks that <lb/>may be reflected in longer-term trends. We used the term &apos;&apos;newly <lb/>identified&apos;&apos; because the medical risk is not &apos;&apos;diagnosed&apos;&apos; until <lb/>confirmed usually with testing on a second specimen and after <lb/>excluding other causes of the laboratory finding. Also, we suspect <lb/>that some participants may have exceeded the defined criteria <lb/>earlier but were not informed by their physicians. Thus, we view <lb/>the HRA serving to identify rather than diagnose new disease risks. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>Table 1 lists the measures used to assess prevalence of disease <lb/>risk and the ability of employer-sponsored HRA with laboratory <lb/>testing to identify previously unrecognized medical conditions. <lb/>Total disease risk prevalence was defined as the proportion of <lb/>participants who self-reported medical condition or had identified <lb/>disease risk as a result of employer-sponsored laboratory testing. <lb/>Unlike other studies that define prevalence on either self-<lb/>identification of disease or laboratory testing, this approach <lb/>provides a broader definition of disease prevalence. This enables <lb/>us to isolate the contribution of employer-sponsored laboratory <lb/>testing in the identification of previously unrecognized disease risk. <lb/>The rate of newly identified risk was defined as the proportion <lb/>of the total risk-identified population who found out about their <lb/>health risks from employer-sponsored laboratory testing. <lb/>For each disease, risk prevalence and rate of newly identified <lb/>risk are explored by age range, gender, and education level. To <lb/>provide greater insight, we characterized the distribution of <lb/>participants by the number of disease risks identified. The number <lb/>of disease risk identifications for any individual participant ranged <lb/>from zero to three (one newly identified risk for each of the three <lb/>medical conditions analyzed). <lb/>Statistical significance is evaluated using Pearson&apos;s chi-squared <lb/>test statistic based on two-sample tests of proportion, performed <lb/>using R 2.12.2 (prop.test). Statistical significance for p-value <lb/>,0.0001 was reported. Gender comparisons were evaluated with <lb/>men as the baseline distribution; age comparisons were evaluated <lb/>with 50 to 64 year old participants as the baseline distribution; and <lb/>the distribution of participants with high school or less education <lb/>was used as the baseline for evaluation of educational impact. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Study Population <lb/>Table 2 summarizes the age and gender distributions of the <lb/>study population. The average ages of men and women were 43.4 <lb/>and 41.7 years, respectively. Women comprised 62.5% of the <lb/>study population. Relatively more women than men were <lb/>represented in the youngest age range (20 to 29 years) and <lb/>relatively more men than women were represented in the oldest <lb/>age range (50 to 64 years). Compared to the overall United States <lb/>population [20], the study population had a relatively larger <lb/>proportion of individuals in the 30 to 49-year age range and a <lb/>relatively smaller proportion in other age ranges, particularly the <lb/>youngest age group. <lb/>Participants came from across the United States, with over-<lb/>representation relative to the 2009 United States population [21] <lb/>in the Mid-and South-Atlantic census regions, and relative under-<lb/>representation in the East North Central and East South Central <lb/>census regions (state of residence was not reported for 10.2% of <lb/>study population participants). The study population was racially <lb/>diverse, with a higher percentage of Asians relative to the similarly-<lb/>aged adult United States population. Caucasians and Hispanics <lb/>were underrepresented relative to the general population (ethnicity <lb/>was not reported for 22.9% of participants). <lb/>The study population had a higher representation of high <lb/>educational achievement than the general population (educational <lb/>attainment was not reported for 0.8% of participants). Overall, <lb/>50.8% of the study population had a bachelor or graduate degree. <lb/>This compares to only 31.4% for the general United States <lb/>population aged 25 years or older. <lb/>Prevalence of disease by Self-Identification <lb/>Twenty-four percent (12,392) who self-reported one or more of <lb/>these medical conditions: 21.1% (11,017 self-identified as having <lb/>hyperlipidemia, 4.7% (2,479) self-identified as having diabetes, <lb/>and 0.7% (352) self-identified as having chronic kidney disease <lb/>Table 3). Men were more likely than women to have each of the <lb/>three medical conditions. The prevalence for each of the three <lb/>medical conditions increased by age range: among the 50 to 64 <lb/>year old participants, hyperlipidemia was self-identified in 36.3%, <lb/>diabetes in 11.8%, and chronic kidney disease in 12.1%. There <lb/>was no clear relationship between educational achievement and <lb/>self-identification of hyperlipidemia or chronic kidney disease <lb/>whereas there was an inverse relationship between educational <lb/>achievement and the self-reported rate of diabetes. <lb/>Incidence of Newly Identified Disease Risk <lb/>More than a third (35.5%) of participants had laboratory <lb/>evidence of one or more disease risk identified through HRA-<lb/>laboratory testing (Table 4). Of these, 92.9% had laboratory <lb/>evidence of one, 7.0% had evidence of two, and 0.1% had <lb/>evidence of all three conditions identified. The rate of newly <lb/>identified disease risk increased progressively with age, ranging <lb/>from 24.4% among 20 to 29 year olds to 41.7% among 50 to 64 <lb/>year olds. Among men, lower levels of educational achievement <lb/>were associated with modestly higher rates of newly identified <lb/>disease risk, ranging from 41.8% for men with high school or less <lb/>to 37.0% for men with graduate degrees (p-value,0.0001). There <lb/>was no clear relationship between educational achievement and <lb/>newly identified disease risk among women. Additionally, we <lb/>observed no clear trend in the rate of disease risk identification <lb/>over the study period. <lb/>Hyperlipidemia <lb/>Overall, more than half of the participants (51.7%) either self-<lb/>reported hyperlipidemia or had laboratory evidence of hyperlipe-<lb/>mia newly identified through the HRA (Table 4). The prevalence <lb/>of hyperlipidemia risk was significantly higher among men (60.3%) <lb/>than women (46.6%) (p-value,0.0001). While age is a significant <lb/>risk factor, we found that the risk for hyperlipidemia began at an <lb/>early age, affecting 29.2% of the youngest age group and increased <lb/>steadily in older groups. <lb/>Of participants with self-reported or laboratory evidence of <lb/>hyperlipidemia, the majority (59.3%) were newly identified <lb/>through the HRA program. The rate of newly identified <lb/>laboratory evidence of disease was high for both men (57.5%) <lb/>and women (60.6%), and was especially high among the youngest <lb/>age range (80.6%). Even among the oldest age group, nearly half <lb/>(47.2%) of those with evidence of hyperlipidemia were newly <lb/>identified through the HRA. No clear trend was observed between <lb/>educational attainment and newly identified risk of hyperlipide-<lb/>mia. <lb/>Diabetes Mellitus <lb/>The total diabetes risk prevalence was 6.6% in our study <lb/>population (Table 4). This included participants who self-reported <lb/>a medical condition or newly identified their health risk through <lb/>the HRA. The diabetes risk prevalence was significantly higher <lb/>among men (8.0%) than women (5.8%) (p-value,0.0001). Risk for <lb/>diabetes began at an early age, affecting 1.7% of adults aged 20 to <lb/>29 and 3.5% of adults aged 30 to 39 years. Among 50 to 64 year <lb/>olds, the risk of diabetes was 11.8%. There was an inverse <lb/>relationship between advancing educational attainment and <lb/>diabetes risk prevalence: diabetes risk was found in 9.2% of adults <lb/>with high school education or less and 5.0% of those adults with <lb/>graduate degrees. <lb/>Among participants with self-reported or laboratory evidence of <lb/>diabetes, 28.4% were newly identified through this program. <lb/>Newly identified disease risk was slightly higher among men <lb/>(30.5%) than women (26.7%) (p-value,0.0001). Nearly 2 in 5 <lb/>(38.7%) participants with diabetes risk in the youngest age range <lb/>(20 to 29) were newly identified; nearly 1 in 4 (23.9%) participants <lb/>between 50 and 64 years old were newly identified. No trend was <lb/>observed between educational attainment and risk of newly <lb/>identified diabetes risk. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>Chronic Kidney Disease <lb/>The total chronic kidney disease risk prevalence was 6.2% in <lb/>our study population (Table 4). This included participants who <lb/>self-reported or newly identified their chronic kidney disease risk <lb/>through the HRA. The chronic kidney disease risk prevalence was <lb/>slightly lower among men (5.7%) than women (6.4%) (p-<lb/>value,0.0001). Risk for chronic kidney disease was identified <lb/>beginning at an early age, affecting 1.0% of adults aged 20 to 29 <lb/>and 2.7% of adults aged 30 to 39 years. Among 50 to 64 year olds, <lb/>the risk of chronic kidney disease was 12.1%. As noted in Table 4, <lb/>the prevalence of total disease risk was similar for chronic kidney <lb/>disease and diabetes. <lb/>Among participants with self-reported or laboratory evidence of <lb/>chronic kidney disease, 89.1% were newly identified through this <lb/>program. The rates of newly identified disease risk were slightly <lb/>lower among men (87.0%) than women (90.2%) (p-value,0.0001), <lb/>but age had a marked effect on the likelihood of a disease being <lb/>newly identified. No trend was observed between educational <lb/>attainment and risk of newly identified chronic kidney disease. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>More than one in three study participants had laboratory <lb/>evidence of at least one common medical condition newly <lb/>identified. The results of this study support the use of laboratory <lb/>testing along with HRA questionnaires to identify previously <lb/>unrecognized disease risk in individuals of all working age ranges, <lb/>regardless of educational level and gender. <lb/>Ideally adults with healthcare insurance would avail them-<lb/>selves of medical services that are typically covered by their <lb/>health plans, including routine physical examinations and <lb/>laboratory tests. Yet, many adults do not seek preventive medical <lb/>care in the absence of symptoms [22]. In one poll of men, 36% <lb/>indicated they would go to the doctor only if &apos;&apos;extremely sick&apos;&apos; <lb/>[23]. HRA with a laboratory component can address this <lb/>shortcoming by uncovering disease risk factors and driving <lb/>participants to seek medical care when risks are identified. <lb/>Recognizing this, many employers increasingly offer HRA with <lb/>laboratory tests. <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>Large Number of Participants with Newly Identified Risk <lb/>The percent of participants with newly identified disease risk <lb/>(35.5%) was significantly higher than the percent of participants <lb/>who self-identified (23.7%) as having one or more of these three <lb/>conditions. This high rate of newly identified risk suggests that our <lb/>current healthcare system fails to identify common disease risk <lb/>factors for a large number of working-age people, even for those <lb/>with access to quality healthcare. Our study also suggests that <lb/>without employer-sponsored laboratory testing, more than 1 in 3 <lb/>working-age adults may have unidentified disease(s). When left <lb/>untreated these conditions can progress to more advanced stages <lb/>with irreversible harm and needless expense. If we extend this <lb/>observation to the United States population aged 20 to 64 years, <lb/>67 million Americans have undiagnosed laboratory markers for <lb/>hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and/or chronic kidney disease. Our <lb/>findings are consistent with broader population studies that <lb/>include non-working adults of all ages [15,24,25], and further <lb/>accentuate the importance of including laboratory testing in <lb/>employer-sponsored HRA. <lb/>Importance of Testing for Chronic Kidney Disease <lb/>The high prevalence of diabetes (25.8 million in the United <lb/>States) is well recognized. Although chronic kidney disease has a <lb/>similar prevalence (26.3 million) [26] awareness of this condition is <lb/>low even among those affected. In our study, 89.1% of participants <lb/>with self-reported or laboratory evidence of chronic kidney disease <lb/>were unaware of their condition. This compares to 28.4% for <lb/>diabetes and 59.3% for hyperlipidemia. Early detection and <lb/>treatment can slow or halt the progression of chronic kidney <lb/>disease and associated co-morbidities [27], including cardiovascu-<lb/>lar disease and diabetes. The findings of this study complement <lb/>other research supporting the inclusion of chronic kidney disease <lb/>testing in employer-sponsored HRA [28]. <lb/>Benefits of Testing Are Widespread <lb/>Our study found that the benefits of employer-sponsored <lb/>laboratory testing are widespread, with high rates of disease risk <lb/>identification for both men and women, and across all age ranges <lb/>and educational achievement. <lb/>While the rates of disease risk identification were high for all <lb/>populations, some groups were impacted more significantly than <lb/>others. Men under the age of 50 years had a higher rate of newly <lb/>identified risk than women. This may be due, in part, to lower <lb/>outpatient physician visit rates among men relative to women [29]. <lb/>Interestingly, the pattern of newly identified disease risk reverses <lb/>among participants 50 to 64 years of age, with women having a <lb/>higher rate of newly identified disease risk than men. While the <lb/>reason for this reversal is unclear, it is possible that men in their <lb/>50 s are increasingly aware and responsive to guidelines suggesting <lb/>population screening for a variety of medical conditions, including <lb/>general guidelines for colorectal cancer screening and discussion of <lb/>prostate cancer screening beginning at age 50 years [30]. <lb/>Professional guidelines typically recommend testing be initiated <lb/>in middle-aged and older adults who are not otherwise at high <lb/>disease risk [12,31]. Younger people are less likely to have a <lb/>personal physician and to seek preventative medical care. Studies <lb/>have shown that younger adults are heavier [32] and more <lb/>sedentary than ever, and therefore exhibit many more risk factors <lb/>than earlier generations for the three medical conditions included <lb/>in this study. Our study suggests that these three conditions are <lb/>more common among younger aged adults than is generally <lb/>recognized. For participants with evidence of hyperlipidemia or <lb/>diabetes, our study found that younger participants were less likely <lb/>to be aware of their condition. Even though the rate of newly <lb/>identified chronic kidney disease increases with age, more than 3 <lb/>out of 5 of the youngest participants with chronic kidney disease <lb/>were newly identified. Our study demonstrates that employer-<lb/>sponsored HRA with laboratory testing reveals important health <lb/>risk information even for younger ages. This supports the value of <lb/>offering broad-based population screening across all ages. <lb/>Many studies from around the world support the relationship <lb/>between health literacy and better health outcomes [33–34,35,36]. <lb/>Although health literacy increases with educational attainment, it <lb/>still remains below proficient for two-thirds of graduate degree <lb/>recipients [37]. Our study suggests that educational achievement <lb/>provides little benefit in the early identification of these three <lb/>common diseases. <lb/>Study Limitations <lb/>Cross-Sectional Population. This study reflects the specific <lb/>health awareness and promotion activities performed by 15 <lb/>employers. Experience of other employers may differ. The study <lb/>population differs from the general working-age population in <lb/>being more highly educated, over-representing women, and <lb/>somewhat skewed based on geography and ethnicity. Contrary <lb/>to prevalent beliefs, these factors had no or minimal impact on our <lb/>findings suggesting that selection-bias would likewise have had no <lb/>or minimal influence on our results. While these differences could <lb/>limit the applicability of these results to the broader working-age <lb/>population, our findings on disease risk prevalence are broadly <lb/>consistent with large population studies [16,24,25]. <lb/>The specific characteristics of incentive programs offered by the <lb/>15 employers may contribute to attracting different participants <lb/>with different disease profiles. Further, employees already under <lb/>medical care or in the other extreme, healthy employees, may <lb/>have chosen not participate. Participants may have participated in <lb/>other HRA prior to participation in Quest Diagnostics Blueprint <lb/>for Wellness through their current or previous employers. <lb/>Accuracy of Self-Reported Disease Awareness. Preexisting <lb/>knowledge of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease is <lb/>based on self-reported data. Differences in how terminology is <lb/>understood may influence reported pre-existing awareness. <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>Subjective factors regarding self-perception and denial may have <lb/>adversely influenced how the respondents self-reported. <lb/>Disease Confirmation. Our disease classification is based <lb/>on laboratory testing from a single blood collection. Although the <lb/>diagnostic thresholds used are consistent with professional <lb/>guidelines, a medical diagnosis requires confirmation of test <lb/>results and syntheses with other clinical findings. Due to biological <lb/>and analytical variation, it is commonly accepted clinical practice <lb/>that for these three medical conditions individuals whose <lb/>laboratory test results exceed diagnostic criteria be retested. <lb/>Thus, the single observations in this study may over-estimate <lb/>undiagnosed chronic medical conditions. For example, many <lb/>factors influence measurement of fasting glucose [38]. An <lb/>NHANES III study examining the reproducibility of fasting <lb/>glucose testing in adults newly identified with diabetes showed that <lb/>70.4% had confirmation of their results [39]. Although <lb/>confirmatory testing is appropriate on an individual basis, our <lb/>methodology is consistent with other population-based studies, <lb/>such as NHANES and the Framingham Heart Study, that use <lb/>laboratory test results from a single snapshot in time. <lb/>Future Directions <lb/>This study focuses on newly detected disease. Additional <lb/>research is needed to assess the role of HRA in disease prevention. <lb/>Furthermore, studies that track laboratory results of HRA <lb/>participants over time are needed to assess and improve <lb/>management of chronic diseases. Finally, the ability of HRA <lb/>participation to modify behaviors (such as diet, exercise, smoking, <lb/>and use of preventive services) needs to be investigated, <lb/>particularly their impact on disease risks measured by laboratory <lb/>tests. <lb/>Specific topics for future research include: 1) whether <lb/>individuals with newly identified disease risk seek medical care; <lb/>2) the optimal frequency for employer-sponsored HRA with <lb/>laboratory testing; and 3) the appropriate use of personalized <lb/>testing based on demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, and/or <lb/>education level), family history, and other biometrics such as BMI <lb/>and blood pressure. <lb/>Summary <lb/>In summary, our findings show that, for a large proportion of <lb/>working-age adults, healthcare access alone does not guarantee <lb/>detection of risk factors for common chronic health conditions. <lb/>The availability of HRA with laboratory tests serves an important <lb/>role in addressing this shortcoming. By identifying such opportu-<lb/>nities early, employer-sponsored laboratory testing may slow or <lb/>prevent the progression of common medical conditions. This has <lb/>clear benefit to employees and their spouses and their domestic <lb/>partners, regardless of age, gender, and educational achievement. <lb/>Similarly, employers who bear much of the financial costs of poor <lb/>disease management may benefit from early detection and <lb/>treatment that can help to avert healthcare costs associated with <lb/>advanced disease. <lb/></body>
