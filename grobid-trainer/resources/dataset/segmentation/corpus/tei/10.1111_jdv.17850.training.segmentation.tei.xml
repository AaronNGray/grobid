		<front>Concomitant SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>infection and crusted scabies in <lb/>a 4-month infant <lb/></front>

		To the Editor, <lb/>

		<body>Crusted scabies (CS) is a severe form of scabies caused by hyper-<lb/>infestation of mites in the horny layer of the epidermis that <lb/>thickens and forms warty crusts. 1 Although it has been described <lb/>mainly in immunosuppressed individuals, it has been also <lb/>observed in otherwise healthy patients. 1 We are living the coron-<lb/>avirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, that is, a mild/mod-<lb/>erate disease in children. 2-4 However, SARS-CoV-2 infection <lb/>may induce significant changes in the host&apos;s immune <lb/>response. 5,6 <lb/>We described a 4-month-old male infant with concomitant <lb/>CS and SARS-CoV-2 infection. He was admitted to our Paedi-<lb/>atric COVID Unit because of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Both par-<lb/>ents were already SARS-CoV-2 positive. Infant&apos;s past medical <lb/>history was unremarkable until the onset of a rash at the age of <lb/>2 months. Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis was made and topical <lb/>hydrocortisone and oral antihistaminics were prescribed for <lb/>1 month. Because of the lack of improvement, he received oral <lb/>betamethasone (10 days) and then a hydrolysed milk, with again <lb/>no improvement. At hospital admission, he presented inappe-<lb/>tence and extreme irritability, with lesions affecting the whole <lb/>body surface, including scalp, with red papules, excoriation, ery-<lb/>throdermia, nail dystrophy and fissures in soles and palms <lb/>(Fig. 1a). He was off therapy since about 2 weeks. During the <lb/>hospital stay, mother revealed an erythematous papular eruption <lb/>with scratching and excoriations on arms and abdomen. She <lb/>reported similar lesions in infant&apos;s grandmother lasting <lb/>3 months. <lb/>This history and the characteristics of lesions drew our atten-<lb/>tion to a possible skin infestation. Dermoscopy of skin scrapings <lb/>of the infant revealed numerous scabies mites and eggs, con-<lb/>firmed by optical microscopic examination of scraped scales. A <lb/>diagnosis of CS was made, while mother received diagnosis of <lb/>ordinary scabies. Laboratory investigation revealed a severe <lb/>hypereosinophilia (Fig. 1c) and high serum IgE (2592 IU/mL, <lb/>normal reference value &lt;15). Screening for immunodeficiency <lb/>was negative. Lymphocyte subset panel showed a slightly low <lb/>NK cells (5%, normal value 7-13). The infant was treated with <lb/>oral antihistamine, topical permethrin 5% and urea 5% on <lb/>hyperkeratotic palmoplantar surfaces for 1 week, with no clini-<lb/>cal and laboratory response. An off-label treatment with oral <lb/>ivermectin (200 µg/kg/dose twice a day, at days 1 and 8) was <lb/>started. An improvement was observed after the third dose of <lb/>ivermectin, with a complete resolution of lesions and normaliza-<lb/>tion of blood test within 2 weeks (Fig. 1b,c). No recurrence of <lb/>scabies or atopic dermatitis was observed during the 4-month <lb/>post-discharge follow-up. As for family members, mother <lb/></body>

			<body>received first topical permethrin with a hypersensitivity reaction <lb/>and subsequent crotamiton, with no response. A treatment with <lb/>ivermectin (2 days) obtained a complete resolution of clinical <lb/>picture. Father received preventive treatment with permethrin at <lb/>home. <lb/>The severe crusted phenotype in our case might have several <lb/>explanations. Firstly, the absence of skin scraping reaction due <lb/>to the very young age of the patient; second, the iatrogenic <lb/>immune suppression due to the prolonged use of <lb/>corticosteroids; third, a possible immunosuppression due to <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5,6 As for laboratory investigation, it has <lb/>been described an aberrant proliferative responses of peripheral <lb/>blood mononuclear cells in CS compared to healthy controls <lb/>and ordinary scabies. 1 A very high eosinophil count in our case <lb/>may be due to the prolonged use of steroids, an immature <lb/>immune system typical of young infants 7 and an impaired <lb/>immune response due to the concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. <lb/>As for treatment, oral ivermectin is reserved for recurrent, diffi-<lb/>cult-to-treat cases, or CS. 8 Due to severe presentation and to <lb/>the refractoriness of the condition with topical treatment, our <lb/>patient required this off-label treatment. An antiviral effect on <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 replication in the early stages of infection has been <lb/>also hypothesized for ivermectin. However, current evidence on <lb/>efficacy of ivermectin in COVID-19 are insufficient. 9 We can <lb/>hypothesize that ivermectin did not affect the course of <lb/>COVID-19 in our patient, also because when he received iver-<lb/>mectin, he was already SARS-CoV-2 positive for at least 1 week. <lb/>This case underlines that an early diagnosis and a prompt treat-<lb/>ment of CS are mandatory in order to prevent superinfection, <lb/>sepsis and clinical deterioration. <lb/></body>

			Trend of sexually transmitted <lb/>infections during the Covid-19 <lb/>age. What was the impact of the <lb/>pandemic and the social <lb/>distancing measures? <lb/>Editor <lb/>Covid-19 pandemic has led to social distancing guidelines and <lb/>resource allocation with subsequent impairment of sexual health <lb/>services. The impact of such measures and the recommendations <lb/>regarding changes of sexual behaviour is a matter of debate. 1-3 <lb/>Published reports have shown conflicting results. Balestri et al. 4 <lb/>suggested that the incidence of STI in 2020 was comparable to <lb/>2019. Bonato et al. 5 reported no differences in the syphilis cases <lb/>with previous years, while Cusini et al. 6 reported a reduction in <lb/>non-acute cases of STI and Latini et al. 7 showed a reduction in <lb/>STI diagnoses. <lb/>For this reason, we have analysed the trends of seven sexually <lb/>transmitted microorganisms in 5809 patients (4911 females and <lb/>898 males) from June 2014 to December 2020. Cervical swabs <lb/>(4495), vaginal swabs (270), seminal fluids (584), gland swabs <lb/>(39), urethral swabs (476), endometrial fluids (1565), oral swabs <lb/>(26) and anal swabs (79) were analysed. In case of multiple dif-<lb/>ferent samples collected from the same patient in the same date, <lb/>the results were pooled as a single one. In case of repetition of <lb/>the testing procedure in other dates, the results were removed by <lb/>a 2-year filter. <lb/>DNA was extracted by MagNa Pure Compact System (Roche <lb/>Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). DNA amplification <lb/>was performed by AnyplexTM II, STI-7 Detection Kit (Seegene, <lb/>Inc. Seoul, Korea). The study was approved by the Ethical Com-<lb/>mittee of Policlinico of Bari. <lb/>The analysis of the yearly positivity rates was performed by <lb/>either Poisson or Quasipoisson regression model. The P-values <lb/>of the models were corrected by Benjamini and Hochberg&apos;s pro-<lb/>cedure. Plots were created by the package ggplot2 implemented <lb/>in R and the calculations of all statistical tests were performed by <lb/>the open-source environment R 4.0.3. 8 P-values &lt; 0.05 were <lb/>considered statistically significant. <lb/>The number of patients remained stable until 2018 and then <lb/>decreased from 2019 (884) to 2020 (616). The percentage of <lb/>female (84.86% in 2020 vs. 83.77% in 2014-2019) and male <lb/>(16.23% in 2020 vs. 15.14% in 2014-2019) patients remained <lb/>stable in 2020 when compared to the previous years (Chi-<lb/>Squared P-value = 0.511). A slight increase of the median age of <lb/>the patients (36.00 [Interquartile Range, IQR: 31.00-42.00] in <lb/>2020 vs. 35.00 [IQR: 30.00-41.00] in 2014-2019) has been also <lb/>observed (Wilcoxon test P-value = 0.010). The prevalence rates <lb/>for each microorganism were not statistically different in the <lb/>year 2020 and the years 2014-2019 (Table 1). Some statistically <lb/>significant differences between females and males have been also <lb/>detected, but the effect size is likely negligible because of the <lb/>small values of the Cramer&apos;s V. UP accounted for the most pre-<lb/>valent microorganism both in females and males followed by <lb/>UU and MH. <lb/>The results of the models to evaluate the yearly trends for each <lb/>microorganism are reported in Fig. 1. After Benjamini and <lb/>Hochberg&apos;s correction, the only P-values of the UP model were <lb/>statistically significant. In particular, the UP positivity rates var-<lb/>ied in a quite complex way increasing from 2014 to a maximum <lb/>value in 2017 followed by a decreasing trend. <lb/>
