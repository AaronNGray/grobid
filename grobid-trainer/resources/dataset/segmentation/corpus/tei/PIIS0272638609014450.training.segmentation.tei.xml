Savage, FMedSci, <lb/>4 and <lb/>Peter Hewins, MBChB, PhD <lb/>1,4 <lb/>Background: Clinical and pathologic features that predict outcome have important potential applica-<lb/>tion in patients with pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis (usually antineutrophil cytoplasmic <lb/>antibody–associated vasculitis). This study examines the predictive value of simple quantitative renal <lb/>histologic measurements in a large cohort with extended follow-up. <lb/>Study Design: Cohort study. <lb/>Setting &amp; Participants: 390 consecutive patients with pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis <lb/>at a single hospital (1983-2002); 90 patients underwent repeated kidney biopsy during follow-up. <lb/>Predictors: Age and serum creatinine concentration at biopsy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody specificity, <lb/>percentage of normal glomeruli, percentage of glomeruli with active lesions, and index of chronic damage <lb/>(quantitative measurement of established cortical damage) in the initial kidney biopsy for all patients. The same <lb/>factors were assessed in both biopsy specimens for patients undergoing an additional biopsy. <lb/>Outcomes &amp; Measurements: End-stage renal disease and patient survival. <lb/>Results: Mortality at 1 and 5 years was 23% and 40%, respectively: standardized mortality ratio, 4.74 <lb/>(95% CI, 3.62-6.32). End-stage renal disease was reached by 14% and 18% at 1 and 5 years, <lb/>respectively. In multivariable analysis, serum creatinine level at biopsy and percentage of normal <lb/>glomeruli in the initial biopsy specimen were the best predictors of kidney survival. C Statistics were 0.80 <lb/>for creatinine level alone and 0.83 for creatinine level with normal glomeruli. In patients undergoing an <lb/>additional biopsy, rapid progression in the index of chronic damage and serum creatinine level at the <lb/>second biopsy were associated with kidney survival in multivariable analysis. <lb/>Limitations: Retrospective analysis. External validity of the index of chronic damage requires further <lb/>assessment. Selection bias may influence repeated biopsy analyses. <lb/>Conclusions: Serum creatinine level at biopsy best predicts kidney survival in patients with <lb/>pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis overall. <lb/>Am J Kidney Dis 55:250-258.

			<body>ulonephritis; <lb/>7,8 however, at least some patients <lb/>with severe kidney disease recover independent <lb/>kidney function when treated appropriately. <lb/>5 <lb/>Whereas the primary purpose of a kidney biopsy <lb/>is diagnostic, it not infrequently reveals a combi-<lb/>nation of acute and chronic lesions that may have <lb/>prognostic relevance. A number of studies have <lb/>highlighted the value of measurements of glomer-<lb/>ular morphologic characteristics in this context; <lb/>however, assessments of tubular and interstitial <lb/>damage frequently are semiquantitative and may <lb/>be subject to greater variability. Moreover, assess-<lb/>ments that involve many components are not <lb/>necessarily readily applicable in routine practice <lb/>outside of specialist centers. <lb/>7,9 <lb/>We have previously described a simple mor-<lb/>phometric measure of chronic damage that as-<lb/>sesses the entire area of renal cortex in a biopsy <lb/>specimen and have shown that the index predicts <lb/>kidney survival in various settings. <lb/>10-12 We hy-<lb/>pothesized that the index would predict kidney <lb/>survival in patients with pauci-immune necrotiz-<lb/>ing glomerulonephritis and, in this study, set out <lb/>to test its performance in comparison to quantita-<lb/>tive measurements of glomerular morphologic <lb/>characteristics in a retrospective cohort of 390 <lb/>patients sampled at a single center. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Clinical Data <lb/>All patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birming-<lb/>ham, UK, with a diagnosis of pauci-immune necrotizing <lb/>glomerulonephritis by kidney biopsy between 1983 and <lb/>2002 were included. Clinical data were obtained from pa-<lb/>tient records (hospital and general practice). Date and cause <lb/>of death were obtained from public records and death <lb/>certificates. Serum creatinine was measured at the time of <lb/>biopsy or before the initiation of acute dialysis therapy if this <lb/>occurred before the biopsy was performed. Biopsies ordi-<lb/>narily were performed before administration of immunosup-<lb/>pressive therapy or shortly thereafter in exceptional cases. <lb/>Repeated biopsies ordinarily were performed before escala-<lb/>tion of immunosuppression. Patients were defined as reach-<lb/>ing the end point of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) when <lb/>they required permanent renal replacement therapy, in other <lb/>words, long-term dialysis therapy or transplant. Patients <lb/>who required acute dialysis at presentation or relapse, but <lb/>who recovered independent kidney function after treatment, <lb/>were not classified as reaching the end point. Time to the end <lb/>point was defined as time elapsed between biopsy (time <lb/>zero) and either death or initiation of permanent renal <lb/>replacement therapy. The status of all patients was deter-<lb/>mined at the end of 2004. Research was conducted in <lb/>accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. <lb/>During the period studied, standard treatments used were <lb/>cyclophosphamide (either pulsed intravenous or daily oral) <lb/>for active disease with high-dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg) <lb/>tapered over 2-3 months. On remission and after 3 to 6 <lb/>months of treatment, patients were switched to maintenance <lb/>therapy with azathioprine and low-dose prednisolone. Few <lb/>patients stopped the medication. Those with either dialysis-<lb/>requiring acute kidney failure or pulmonary hemorrhage <lb/>were treated using plasma exchange. <lb/>Death certificates were available for 186 of 214 patients <lb/>who died. Forty-three patients died within 3 months of <lb/>diagnosis, and certified causes of death in these cases were <lb/>kidney failure, vasculitis, or infection. We classified all <lb/>deaths during this period as related to active vasculitis <lb/>because infection was presumed to be secondary to intensive <lb/>immunosuppression. Deaths attributed to infection Ͼ 3 <lb/>months after diagnosis were coded separately. <lb/>Measurement of Index of Chronic Damage and Other <lb/>Pathologic Investigations <lb/>Stored slides of renal biopsy specimens were examined <lb/>retrospectively without knowledge of patient details and <lb/>irrespective of the number of glomeruli in the specimen. On <lb/>a representative section, usually stained using periodic acid– <lb/>methenamine silver, the total number of glomeruli was <lb/>counted. Each glomerulus was put into 1 of 5 categories, <lb/>which were summed for each biopsy and expressed as <lb/>percentages of the total number of glomeruli: normal glo-<lb/>meruli, globally sclerosed glomeruli, glomeruli with isch-<lb/>emic shrinkage, glomeruli with active vasculitic lesions, and <lb/>glomeruli with healed vasculitic lesions. Active vasculitic <lb/>lesions were defined as segmental or global areas of combi-<lb/>nations of thrombosis, disruption of capillary basement <lb/>membranes, and cells in Bowman space. Healed vasculitic <lb/>lesions were defined as those in which areas of fibrosis <lb/>included the glomerular tuft and Bowman space. Active and <lb/>healed segmental lesions usually were sharply demarcated <lb/>from the rest of the glomerulus. Lesions that were healing <lb/>were arbitrarily assigned to active or healed categories based <lb/>on the relative amounts of cells and fibers in the lesions. <lb/>Arteritis or arteriolitis was diagnosed by the finding of <lb/>fibrinoid necrosis and/or an inflammatory infiltrate in the <lb/>wall of relevant vessels. <lb/>The index of chronic damage was measured in each <lb/>biopsy specimen as previously described. <lb/>10-12 Briefly, using <lb/>a digital image of renal cortex, atrophic areas were outlined <lb/>by freehand and their cross-sectional areas were measured in <lb/>pixels. Atrophic areas were defined as those containing any <lb/>combination of globally sclerosed glomeruli, shrunken tu-<lb/>bules with thickened basement membranes, interstitial fibro-<lb/>sis, cysts, and occluded vessels. The cortex in the image then <lb/>was outlined and its area was measured. This was repeated <lb/>until all cortex was measured. The total of atrophic areas was <lb/>expressed as a percentage of total cortical area and called the <lb/>index of chronic damage. This could range from 0% in a <lb/>kidney without no chronic damage to 100% in a completely <lb/>atrophic kidney. <lb/>Previously, the limits of interobserver agreement for the <lb/>index of chronic damage were determined to be between <lb/>0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.93) and 1.22 <lb/></body>

			<body>(95% CI, 1.15-1.30), with a mean agreement of 1.03 (95% <lb/>CI, 0.99-1.07). <lb/>11 The limits of intraobserver agreement were <lb/>0.79 (95% CI, 0.74-0.85) and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.20-1.39), with <lb/>a mean of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.06). <lb/>11 The definition of the <lb/>index of chronic damage is listed in Box 1. <lb/>Data Analysis <lb/>Analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, ver-<lb/>sion 14 (SPSS Inc, www.spss.com/uk/). Univariable and <lb/>multivariable survival analyses were performed initially <lb/>using stepwise Cox regression with creatinine level as a <lb/>continuous variable. Histologic parameters were divided <lb/>into groups of 1 standard deviation to make hazard ratios <lb/>more meaningful. When Ͼ 1 biopsy was performed, only the <lb/>initial presenting biopsy specimen was used in these analy-<lb/>ses. Time origin (t ϭ 0) was the value of the parameter at the <lb/>initial presenting biopsy. If a patient did not progress to <lb/>ESRD, they were censored at either death or last follow-up, <lb/>with the latter at least 2 years after the initial presentation. <lb/>Correlations of pathologic variables with serum creatinine <lb/>concentrations at biopsy or ANCA status were computed <lb/>using Spearman rank correlation for nonparametric vari-<lb/>ables. The C statistic is the proportion of pairs of individuals <lb/>for which the model correctly predicted which individual <lb/>had the shorter time to event (pairs for which this is not <lb/>known were excluded from the calculation). <lb/>In analysis of the repeated biopsy data, when there were Ͼ 2 <lb/>biopsies available, only the earliest and most recent were <lb/>analyzed. Patients underwent a repeated biopsy because <lb/>of either a suspected disease flare or inadequate response <lb/>to therapy. As such, this group is subject to selection bias. <lb/>Rates of changes in the index of chronic damage, percent-<lb/>age of normal glomeruli, and serum creatinine concentra-<lb/>tion were calculated by dividing the change in each <lb/>parameter between the 2 biopsies by the time separating <lb/>the 2 samples. <lb/>Further analysis of the initial biopsy data was performed <lb/>by dividing the population into quartiles of percentage of <lb/>normal glomeruli. Quartile division was not possible for the <lb/>index of chronic damage because a large number of biopsy <lb/>specimens showed an index of 0%. Therefore, this parame-<lb/>ter was divided into 4 groups: all biopsy specimens with an <lb/>index of 0% and the remainder of the population divided into <lb/>tertiles. Differences between groups in progression to ESRD <lb/>were calculated using stepwise Cox regression. A likelihood <lb/>ratio comparing goodness of fit was used to test for interac-<lb/>tions between creatinine level and 2 histologic variables <lb/>(percentage of normal glomeruli and index of chronic dam-<lb/>age) in multivariable analysis of the entire population. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Baseline Characteristics and Overall Outcomes <lb/>During the study period, 390 patients were <lb/>given a diagnosis of pauci-immune necrotizing <lb/>glomerulonephritis. Of these, 90 patients under-<lb/>went Ͼ 1 kidney biopsy, but only initial biopsies <lb/>were included in the analysis unless otherwise <lb/>stated (see Repeated Biopsy Data in this section). <lb/>Median age at initial biopsy was 64 years (range, <lb/>15-90 years), and median serum creatinine level <lb/>at biopsy was 3.86 mg/dL (range, 0.52-20.6 <lb/>mg/dL). Follow-up was until patient death or for <lb/>at least 2 years from the initial biopsy for surviv-<lb/>ing patients, with median follow-up of 166 weeks <lb/>(range, 1 day-1,256 weeks). During follow-up, <lb/>214 (55%) patients died: 89 (23%) during the <lb/>first year, 149 (40%) by 5 years, and 184 (49%) <lb/>by 10 years. Permanent renal replacement therapy <lb/>was required in 87 (22%) patients: 54 (14%) in <lb/>the first year, 67 (18%) by 5 years, and 76 (21%) <lb/>by 10 years. <lb/>In the present cohort, the median index of <lb/>chronic damage was 10% (range, 0%-94%). Base-<lb/>line characteristics and outcomes for patients <lb/>segregated by index of chronic damage values <lb/>are listed in Table 1. Median percentage of normal <lb/>glomeruli was 31% (range, 0%-100%), and median <lb/>percentage of glomeruli with active lesions was <lb/>19% (range, 0%-100%). ANCA immunofluores-<lb/>cence data were available for 230 patients. Pe-<lb/>rinuclear ANCA (pANCA)-positive patients were <lb/>significantly older at presentation than cytoplasmic <lb/>ANCA (cANCA) patients (median age, 67 vs 57 <lb/>years; P Ͻ 0.001). The mean index of chronic <lb/>damage was significantly higher in pANCA-posi-<lb/>tive patients (31.17% vs 19.55%; P ϭ 0.003), <lb/>which remained significant after correction for age <lb/>(P ϭ 0.04). Furthermore, pANCA-positive patients <lb/>had a higher percentage of globally sclerosed glo-<lb/>meruli (P Ͻ 0.001), whereas cANCA-positive pa-<lb/>Box 1.

This <lb/>was reflected in C statistics for Cox regression: <lb/>C ϭ 0.8 for creatinine level alone and C ϭ 0.83 for <lb/>creatinine level with percentage of normal glo-<lb/>meruli. No significant interaction was shown be-<lb/>tween serum creatinine level and either percentage <lb/>of normal glomeruli or index of chronic damage. <lb/>Considering those for whom ANCA immunofluo-<lb/>rescence was known, there was no difference in <lb/>progression to ESRD between pANCA-and <lb/>cANCA-positive patients (P ϭ 0.9). <lb/>Dividing the index of chronic damage into <lb/>groups suggested a threshold effect because kid-<lb/>ney outcome did not differ significantly for the <lb/>first 3 groups. However, the fourth group (Ն48% <lb/>chronic damage) had a significantly worse kid-<lb/>ney outcome (Table 1). A threshold effect also <lb/>was apparent for normal glomeruli because pro-<lb/>gression to ESRD did not differ significantly for <lb/>the third (32%-65%) compared with the fourth <lb/>quartile (Ն66%), whereas progression to ESRD <lb/>was significantly more frequent for the first (0%-<lb/>8%) and second (9%-31%) quartiles (ie, biopsy <lb/>specimens showing the least normal glomeruli; <lb/>Table 4). Conversely, the second, third, and fourth <lb/>quartiles of normal glomeruli had better kidney <lb/>outcomes than the first quartile (Յ8%; not shown). <lb/>Repeated Biopsy Data <lb/>Data confirm that histologic variables mea-<lb/>sured in a first biopsy specimen are associated <lb/>with ESRD across the entire patient cohort.

			<body>of chronic damage (0.11%/d vs 0.009%/d) were <lb/>associated with progression to ESRD (Table 5). <lb/>For the entire subgroup, median rate of change in <lb/>the index of chronic damage was ϩ10.76%/y <lb/>(Fig 1). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The prognosis for patients with pauci-immune <lb/>necrotizing glomerulonephritis has improved with <lb/>therapeutic immunosuppression. <lb/>2,3 Nonetheless, <lb/>by 5 years, 18% of patients in this cohort re-<lb/>quired permanent renal replacement therapy and <lb/>40% had died. Previous studies also have re-<lb/>ported high mortality in patients with systemic <lb/>vasculitis. <lb/>21,23 Allowing for the limitations of <lb/>accuracy in death certification, the high rate of <lb/>infection-related mortality in this study supports <lb/>the hypothesis that adverse effects of therapy <lb/>contribute to poor outcome and emphasizes the <lb/>advantage of identifying patients with salvage-<lb/>able kidney function. <lb/>Previous smaller studies have reported more <lb/>long-term damage in pANCA/myeloperoxidase-<lb/>ANCA–positive versus cANCA/proteinase <lb/>3–ANCA patients, but similar outcomes. <lb/>9,19-22 <lb/>Our study supports this concept and indicates <lb/>that ANCA subtype should not influence treat-<lb/>ment. The basis of the difference in pathologic <lb/>features between the 2 subgroups is uncertain <lb/>and could reflect either earlier diagnosis in <lb/>patients with cANCA (perhaps because of promi-<lb/>nent extrarenal symptoms) or genuinely diver-<lb/>gent disease characteristics. <lb/>Other studies of kidney biopsies in patients <lb/>with systemic vasculitis (Table 6) have involved <lb/>relatively complex scoring systems. <lb/>7,9,17,22,25,26 <lb/>Moreover, the consistency of biopsy interpreta-<lb/>tion in patients with pauci-immune necrotizing <lb/>glomerulonephritis is uncertain because al-<lb/>though quantitative measurements of glomeru-<lb/>lar morphologic characteristics show satisfac-<lb/>tory agreement, interobserver agreement for <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>dichotomous variables used to score tubuloin-<lb/>terstitial damage appears to be poor. <lb/>13 Simi-<lb/>larly, the reproducibility and predictive value <lb/>of semiquantitative chronicity scores in pa-<lb/>tients with lupus nephritis is controversial, and <lb/>their applicability outside specialist referral <lb/>centers is disputed. <lb/>14,15 More recently, com-<lb/>puter-assisted morphometric assessment of lu-<lb/>pus nephritis has been described and has pre-<lb/>dicted outcome in a relatively small cohort <lb/>(n ϭ 48). <lb/>16 <lb/>Our study comprises a large cohort with a <lb/>unified diagnosis and extended follow-up. Se-<lb/>rum creatinine level at biopsy correlated with <lb/>glomerular morphologic characteristics, as pre-<lb/>viously reported, <lb/>7,8 and with index of chronic <lb/>damage. Furthermore, both glomerular morpho-<lb/>logic characteristics and the index of chronic <lb/>damage significantly correlated with kidney <lb/>outcome. Multivariable analysis showed se-<lb/>rum creatinine level at biopsy and percentage <lb/>of normal glomeruli in the initial biopsy speci-<lb/>men to be independent predictors of ESRD. As <lb/>in other studies, no pathologic features pre-<lb/>dicted death, which was predicted by age and <lb/>serum creatinine level at biopsy. <lb/>In a subgroup of patients undergoing re-<lb/>peated biopsy (performed in the context of <lb/>suspected disease flare or inadequate response <lb/>to therapy), accelerated change in the index of <lb/>chronic damage was associated independently <lb/>with kidney outcome, whereas percentage of <lb/>normal glomeruli was not. Previous studies <lb/>using repeated biopsy data have shown progres-<lb/>sion of chronic damage (semiquantitatively <lb/>scored) <lb/>17 or an increase in global glomerulo-<lb/>sclerosis, <lb/>18 but not an association with progres-<lb/>sion to ESRD. The index of chronic damage <lb/>might provide additional information because <lb/>it reflects irreversible damage in the tubulo-<lb/>interstitial and vascular compartments, as well <lb/>as glomerular scarring. Furthermore, the index <lb/>may be more meaningful when a biopsy speci-<lb/>men contains only a few glomeruli. We have <lb/>already reported that the index is an indicator <lb/>of progression to ESRD in patients with lupus <lb/>nephritis <lb/>11 and in a heterogeneous cohort of <lb/>patients with chronic kidney disease <lb/>10 (pre-<lb/>dominantly immunoglobulin A nephropathy and <lb/>Henoch-Schönlein nephritis). <lb/>There are several limitations to our study. It <lb/>was a retrospective analysis with uncontrolled <lb/>differences between patient groups, mainly in <lb/>treatment regimens. ANCA specificity was an-<lb/>alyzed using indirect immunofluorescence <lb/>rather than enzyme-linked immunosorbent as-<lb/>say and was recorded in only 59% (230/390) of <lb/>patients, reflecting the available data set, rather <lb/>than an unusually high proportion of truly <lb/>ANCA-negative cases. In addition, there has <lb/>been only limited assessment of the extent of <lb/>inter-and intraobserver agreement using the <lb/>index of chronic damage. Previous studies <lb/>involving a small number of pathologists have <lb/>shown that the degree of variation is low, <lb/>10 but <lb/>this merits confirmation. Furthermore, re-<lb/>peated biopsy analyses could be affected by <lb/>selection bias. <lb/>Although histologic variables can correlate <lb/>with or predict kidney outcome, histology has <lb/>not yet been used to direct treatment in a trial <lb/>setting. An analysis of biopsies from the <lb/>MEPEX (methyl prednisolone or plasma ex-<lb/>change for severe renal vasculitis) trial con-<lb/>cluded that for patients receiving plasma ex-<lb/>change, the chance of kidney recovery always <lb/>exceeds the risk of therapy-related death regard-<lb/>less of the severity or nature of histopathologic <lb/>change. <lb/>24 This suggests that treatment should <lb/>not be restricted for patients who present with <lb/>Figure 1. Progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) <lb/>stratified by rate of decrease in index of chronic damage <lb/>between the first and last renal biopsy specimens (P Ͻ <lb/>0.001).
