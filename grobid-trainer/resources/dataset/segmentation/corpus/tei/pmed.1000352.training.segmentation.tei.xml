The <lb/>industry claims that promotion provides scientific and educational information to physicians. While some evidence indicates <lb/>that promotion may adversely influence prescribing, physicians hold a wide range of views about pharmaceutical <lb/>promotion. The objective of this review is to examine the relationship between exposure to information from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies and the quality, quantity, and cost of physicians&apos; prescribing. <lb/>Methods and Findings: We searched for studies of physicians with prescribing rights who were exposed to information from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies (promotional or otherwise). Exposures included pharmaceutical sales representative visits, journal <lb/>advertisements, attendance at pharmaceutical sponsored meetings, mailed information, prescribing software, and participation <lb/>in sponsored clinical trials. The outcomes measured were quality, quantity, and cost of physicians&apos; prescribing. We searched <lb/>Medline (1966 to February 2008), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to February 2008), Embase (1997 to February <lb/>2008), Current Contents (2001 to 2008), and Central (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007) using the search terms developed with <lb/>an expert librarian. Additionally, we reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and pharmaceutical companies for <lb/>information. Randomized and observational studies evaluating information from pharmaceutical companies and measures of <lb/>physicians&apos; prescribing were independently appraised for methodological quality by two authors. Studies were excluded where <lb/>insufficient study information precluded appraisal. The full text of 255 articles was retrieved from electronic databases (7,185 <lb/>studies) and other sources (138 studies). Articles were then excluded because they did not fulfil inclusion criteria (179) or quality <lb/>appraisal criteria (18), leaving 58 included studies with 87 distinct analyses. Data were extracted independently by two authors <lb/>and a narrative synthesis performed following the MOOSE guidelines. Of the set of studies examining prescribing quality <lb/>outcomes, five found associations between exposure to pharmaceutical company information and lower quality prescribing, <lb/>four did not detect an association, and one found associations with lower and higher quality prescribing. 38 included studies <lb/>found associations between exposure and higher frequency of prescribing and 13 did not detect an association. Five included <lb/>studies found evidence for association with higher costs, four found no association, and one found an association with lower <lb/>costs. The narrative synthesis finding of variable results was supported by a meta-analysis of studies of prescribing frequency <lb/>that found significant heterogeneity. The observational nature of most included studies is the main limitation of this review. <lb/>Conclusions: With rare exceptions, studies of exposure to information provided directly by pharmaceutical companies have <lb/>found associations with higher prescribing frequency, higher costs, or lower prescribing quality or have not found <lb/>significant associations. We did not find evidence of net improvements in prescribing, but the available literature does not <lb/>exclude the possibility that prescribing may sometimes be improved. Still, we recommend that practitioners follow the <lb/>precautionary principle and thus avoid exposure to information from pharmaceutical companies. <lb/>Please see later in the article for the Editors&apos; Summary. <lb/>Citation: Spurling GK, Mansfield PR, Montgomery BD, Lexchin J, Doust J, et al.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Pharmaceutical companies in the United States spent about <lb/>US$57.5 billion, or 24.4% of their revenue, on promotion in 2004 <lb/>[1]. One estimate of total promotional expenditure in France for <lb/>2004 is J2,908 million (12.2% of revenue). However, another <lb/>estimate is that pharmaceutical detailing cost J3,300 million and <lb/>accounted for 75% of the overall cost of promotion in that year <lb/>making promotion 17.3% of revenue [2]. Expenditure on <lb/>promotion is aimed at maximizing returns for the corporation <lb/>and shareholders [3]. The industry claims that promotion also <lb/>provides scientific and educational information to healthcare <lb/>professionals: &apos;&apos;Appropriate marketing of medicines ensures that <lb/>patients have access to the products they need and that the <lb/>products are used correctly for maximum patient benefit. Our <lb/>relationships with healthcare professionals are critical to achieving <lb/>these goals because they enable us to – inform healthcare <lb/>professionals about the benefits and risks of our products to help <lb/>advance appropriate patient use, provide scientific and education-<lb/>al information, support medical research and education&apos;&apos; [4]. <lb/>There is a wide range of views amongst health professionals <lb/>about pharmaceutical promotion. Qualitative studies suggest that <lb/>many perceive pharmaceutical promotion to be a useful and <lb/>convenient source of information [5–7]. Some doctors deny that <lb/>they are influenced by pharmaceutical company promotion or <lb/>claim that it influences others but not themselves [8–10]. <lb/>Nonetheless, many of these physicians are willing to give <lb/>significant amounts of time to engaging in promotional activities <lb/>[11]. By contrast, several professional organisations have called for <lb/>more control of promotional activities [12,13] because of evidence <lb/>that promotion may be misleading [14–17]. <lb/>The evidence base illuminating these conflicting views is <lb/>growing. In 2000, Wazana identified eight studies linking <lb/>pharmaceutical promotion to increased prescribing, &apos;&apos;nonrational <lb/>prescribing,&apos;&apos; and increased prescribing costs [18]. A 2005 review <lb/>concluded that promotion influences the prescribing by physicians <lb/>in training [19], and a second review in the same year concluded <lb/>that sales representatives influence prescribing [20]. <lb/>Those previous reviews are now out of date, narrowly focused, <lb/>or only partially assessed the relationship between information <lb/>(promotional or otherwise) from pharmaceutical companies and <lb/>prescribing costs and quality. The objective of this review is to <lb/>examine the relationship between exposure to information directly <lb/>provided by pharmaceutical companies and the quality, quantity, <lb/>and cost of physicians&apos; prescribing. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Criteria for Including Studies <lb/>Randomized controlled trials, time series analyses, before–after <lb/>studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, ecological studies, and <lb/>cross-sectional studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies were <lb/>included if they had both a measure of exposure to any type of <lb/>information directly provided by pharmaceutical companies and a <lb/>measure of physicians&apos; prescribing. We excluded studies that <lb/>looked at the indirect provision of information, for example, <lb/>through continuing medical education courses that were funded by <lb/>unrestricted grants from pharmaceutical companies. Case series, <lb/>case reports, abstracts, news items, and short reports were <lb/>excluded. <lb/>Exposure to information directly provided by pharmaceutical <lb/>companies was defined as including pharmaceutical sales repre-<lb/>sentative visits, advertisements in journals or prescribing software, <lb/>presentations from pharmaceutical companies to groups, meetings <lb/>sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, mailed information <lb/>including advertisements, and participation in sponsored clinical <lb/>trials. We did not include studies of other forms of promotion such <lb/>as gifts or samples or studies of indirect forms of information <lb/>provision such as sponsored education. <lb/>The outcome measures were the quality, frequency, and costs of <lb/>prescribing. <lb/>Search Methods for Identification of Studies <lb/>We searched Medline (1966 to February 2008), International <lb/>Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to February 2008), Embase (1997 <lb/>to February 2008), Current Contents (2001 to 2008), and Central <lb/>(The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007). The search strategy below <lb/>was devised for Medline by an expert librarian at the University of <lb/>Queensland and adapted for the other databases: (exp Drug <lb/>Industry OR exp Advertising OR exp Gift Giving OR exp <lb/>&apos;&apos;Conflict of Interest&apos;&apos;) AND (exp Prescriptions, Drug/OR <lb/>(prescribing or prescription$).mp.)) <lb/>We looked for additional articles in the references of each <lb/>retrieved article including review articles in an iterative, exhaustive <lb/>process. Efforts to find additional studies included placement of <lb/>messages on email drug discussion groups, contacting experts in <lb/>the field, and asking Australian subsidiaries of international <lb/>pharmaceutical companies for information. All languages were <lb/>considered. <lb/>Selection of Studies <lb/>The title and abstract, if available, of all articles detected by the <lb/>database searches were reviewed by two authors. Articles that <lb/>possibly met the inclusion criteria were retrieved and subjected to <lb/>a formal inclusion process independently by two different authors. <lb/>Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus and if necessary <lb/>a third author was involved. <lb/>Quality Appraisal <lb/>Articles meeting inclusion criteria were appraised for method-<lb/>ological quality independently by two authors. Randomized <lb/>studies were assessed for adequacy of randomization method, <lb/>allocation concealment, blinding, follow-up, and use of intention <lb/>to treat analyses [21]. Controlled cohort and case-control studies <lb/>were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scales [22]. For other <lb/>nonrandomized studies, quality appraisal included assessment of <lb/>sources of bias, for example presence of a control group, selection <lb/>methods, control of confounding, response rate (.80%), and use <lb/>of appropriate statistical tests [23]. Studies were only excluded <lb/>from the review if two authors found there was insufficient <lb/>information to appraise their quality. Disagreements were resolved <lb/>by discussion with a third author. <lb/>Data Extraction <lb/>For included studies, two authors independently extracted data <lb/>on study site, dates of data collection or publication, types of <lb/>participants (primary care providers, specialists, and residents), <lb/>study medication(s), exposure to information from pharmaceutical <lb/>companies, and prescribing outcomes. <lb/>Reporting of Results <lb/>For quality of prescribing we accepted the original authors&apos; <lb/>definitions of what constituted more (or less) appropriate <lb/>prescribing. <lb/>We divided studies into two groups on the basis of whether the <lb/>information was delivered with or without conventional promo-<lb/>tional techniques. This distinction was made because information <lb/></body>

			<body>delivered with versus without conventional promotion may <lb/>produce different effects on prescribing. <lb/>Conventional promotional techniques were defined as adver-<lb/>tisements (in journals and software), representatives&apos; visits, <lb/>attendance at pharmaceutical sponsored meetings, and mailed <lb/>information from pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we <lb/>included in this group studies looking at total promotional <lb/>investment/summated scores of commercial information use/ <lb/>general use of commercial sources. The other group of studies <lb/>included warning letters, participation in company sponsored <lb/>trials, and representatives&apos; visits for nonpromotional purposes. <lb/>A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken following the <lb/>MOOSE guidelines and meta-analysis performed where appro-<lb/>priate data were available (Text S1) [24]. The unit of analysis was <lb/>defined as the combination of exposure to a type of information <lb/>from a pharmaceutical company (for example pharmaceutical <lb/>sales representative visits or journal advertisements) and a type of <lb/>prescribing outcome (quality, frequency, and cost of prescribing). <lb/>Thus studies were treated as a single unit of analysis if they <lb/>measured the same type of exposure and the same type of outcome <lb/>regardless of the number of drugs covered in each study. We <lb/>classified each analysis as positive or negative rather than no <lb/>association detected if the p value was less than 5% (p,0.05) <lb/>regardless of the magnitude of the effect. <lb/>We reported standardized effect measures (Pearson correlation <lb/>coefficients, odds ratios [ORs], or beta coefficients) where study <lb/>reports provided them or the data needed to calculate them. For <lb/>econometric studies, we also reported t statistics where they were <lb/>reported or it was possible to calculate them. <lb/>Meta-analysis was not appropriate for the outcomes of quality of <lb/>prescribing and cost of prescribing because in both cases the <lb/>studies examined different exposures or outcome measures and/or <lb/>lacked control groups. We undertook a meta-analysis for one <lb/>component—studies of frequency of prescribing with identifiable <lb/>control groups where the information exposure was delivered with <lb/>conventional promotional techniques. We used ORs for change in <lb/>prescribing frequency as the outcome measure. Where studies had <lb/>suitable designs for inclusion in the meta-analysis but ORs and <lb/>standard errors were not published we contacted corresponding <lb/>authors. Out of ten studies [25–34], we received four replies of <lb/>which three provided the information we required [29–31]. <lb/>Heterogeneity was assessed using the tau squared test with a <lb/>sensitivity analysis to investigate likely sources of heterogeneity. <lb/>Factors identified a priori as possible explanations for heteroge-<lb/>neity were study design, study quality indicators, year of <lb/>publication, type of exposure to pharmaceutical company <lb/>information (active versus passive), and physician characteristics <lb/>(level of experience and also primary care provider versus <lb/>specialist). We defined active exposure as information presented <lb/>to physicians at meetings or during pharmaceutical sales <lb/>representatives&apos; visits. We defined passive exposure as journal <lb/>advertisements, mailed information, advertisements on clinical <lb/>software, and participation in sponsored clinical trials. Studies <lb/>reporting more than one unit of analysis were subjected to <lb/>sensitivity analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan <lb/>(version 5.0.24) with further analysis conducted using Stata version <lb/>10.0 (Stata Corporation). <lb/>Results <lb/>Search Results <lb/>Our search found 7,185 studies from electronic databases and <lb/>138 studies were retrieved from reference lists, experts in the field <lb/>and email lists. The full text of 255 articles was retrieved. 18 <lb/>studies were excluded, all because inadequate reporting precluded <lb/>quality assessment. Quality appraisal results for included studies <lb/>are presented in Tables 1–5. Following application of inclusion/ <lb/>exclusion criteria and quality appraisal, 58 studies were included in <lb/>the review (52 published in journals [25–33,35–77], three reports <lb/>[78–80], one dissertation [34], one conference presentation [81], <lb/>and one conference poster [82] (Figure 1). Of these 58, 29 studies <lb/>came from database searches [25–31,33,35–38,41,44,55,56,59– <lb/>62,66–68,70–72,74,76,77], 22 studies came from reference lists <lb/>[32,39,40,46–54,58,63–65,69,73,75,78,79], five studies came from <lb/>experts in the field [34,43,57,81,82], and two from email lists <lb/>[45,80]. These 58 studies included 87 units of analysis. <lb/>Pharmaceutical companies provided 62 citations; two of these <lb/>met our inclusion criteria and had already been identified through <lb/>Medline searches [27,35]. Five of the studies located through the <lb/>e-mail lists and experts were not indexed in the databases we <lb/>searched [34,43,80–82]. For one study [78], additional data were <lb/>obtained from the authors [83]. <lb/>General Characteristics of Studies <lb/>The most common study design was cross-sectional (24/58 <lb/>studies, 41%). There were also two cluster randomized controlled <lb/>trials, one controlled-cohort study, two case-control studies, 24 <lb/>time-series analyses, and five before–after studies. Over half (55%) <lb/>of the studies were conducted in the United States. Characteristics <lb/>of included studies are outlined in Table 6. <lb/>Pharmaceutical Company Information and Prescribing <lb/>Quality <lb/>Prescribing quality was measured by ten studies with 14 units of <lb/>analysis [37,39,58,59,61,64,74,77,81,82] (Table 7). Quality was <lb/>assessed in four distinct ways: quality scoring of prescribing <lb/>decisions, guideline adherence, prescribing appropriateness of an <lb/>individual drug class, and prescribing range. Three studies used <lb/>quality scores calculated by coding physicians&apos; drug choices in <lb/>responses to clinical vignettes [74,81,82]. One of these used an <lb/>expert panel to derive a quality index (1–100) judging primary <lb/>care providers&apos; prescribing in response to both their actual <lb/>prescribing and clinical vignettes [81]. In the latter study learning <lb/>about the drug first from pharmaceutical sales representatives was <lb/>associated with lower quality of actual prescribing but the number <lb/>of pharmaceutical sales representatives&apos; visits was not. There was <lb/>no significant association between primary care providers seeing <lb/>more pharmaceutical sales representatives or first learning about <lb/>the drug from pharmaceutical sales representatives and lower <lb/>quality responses to case vignettes [81]. Another study combined <lb/>scales examining indication, effectiveness, safety, dosage, duration, <lb/>and polypharmacy to produce a seven-point scale measuring <lb/>rationality of prescribing [74]. Primary care providers&apos; self-<lb/>reported reliance on pharmaceutical companies for information <lb/>was associated with lower quality scores [74]. A third study used a <lb/>quality score for a hypertension scenario where thiazides were <lb/>considered very appropriate and all other drug groups were <lb/>considered very inappropriate [82]. Self-reported rates of <lb/>attendance at pharmaceutical company-sponsored meetings were <lb/>associated with slightly lower quality scores, but self-reported rates <lb/>of pharmaceutical sales representative visits had no significant <lb/>association [82]. <lb/>Residents attending a sponsored meeting were more likely than <lb/>nonattending residents at the same hospital to prescribe the <lb/>sponsoring company&apos;s medication, both when it was appropriate <lb/>according to the authors and when it was not [39]. <lb/>Primary care providers who saw more pharmaceutical sales <lb/>representatives and those who used the pharmaceutical industry in <lb/></body>

			<body>general as a source of information prescribed a wider range of <lb/>drugs [61]. The authors suggested that this was a sign of lower <lb/>prescribing quality in the context of recommendations that <lb/>primary care providers use a limited list of drugs they know well <lb/>[61]. <lb/>Two studies measured guideline adherence. One found less <lb/>adherence by primary care providers who received more frequent <lb/>visits from pharmaceutical sales representatives [64], while the <lb/>other found no change in adherence by primary care providers <lb/>participating in a clinical trial sponsored by a pharmaceutical <lb/>company [37]. <lb/>One study of warnings conveyed by pharmaceutical sales <lb/>representatives and mailed information [58], one of mailed <lb/>warnings alone [59], and one of representatives&apos; visits and <lb/>advertisements [77] found that there was no alteration in overall <lb/>rates of prescriptions judged to be inappropriate. <lb/>Pharmaceutical Company Information and Prescribing <lb/>Frequency <lb/>51 studies [25–54,56–60,62,63,65,67–70,72,73,75–81] mea-<lb/>sured prescribing frequency as market share, intention to <lb/>prescribe, prescription sales, formulary requests, as well as number <lb/>of prescriptions (63 units of analysis) (Table 8). Below we report <lb/>separately the results of studies of information delivered with <lb/>versus without conventional promotion. Within both groups there <lb/>was one unit of analysis per study. <lb/>Conventional Promotional Techniques <lb/>Pharmaceutical sales representative visits. Of the 29 <lb/>studies of pharmaceutical sales representative visits, 17 found only <lb/>an association with increased prescribing of the promoted drug <lb/>[26,32,33,38,40,43–50,63,67,78,79]. None found less frequent <lb/>prescribing. Of the remaining 11, six studies had mixed results: <lb/>finding a significant association with more frequent prescribing for <lb/>some measures but no significant association for others <lb/>[27,42,62,69,73,81]. Five did not detect any significant <lb/>relationship [31,52,68,72,77]. One study did not use statistical <lb/>tests for associations. It found that during the time that spending <lb/>by pharmaceutical companies on promotion of a medication <lb/>dropped to zero, there was also a significant drop in prescribing of <lb/>that medication. However most of the decreases in promotion and <lb/>prescribing occurred after the publication of evidence of problems <lb/>with that medication [56]. <lb/>Nine of these studies with either positive or mixed results <lb/>provided insights into features of pharmaceutical sales represen-<lb/>tative visits that modified the impact of these visits on prescribing <lb/>[40,46,49,62,67,69,73,78]. An association with more frequent <lb/>prescribing was more likely when pharmaceutical sales represen-<lb/>tatives visited groups of physicians, when physicians had lower <lb/>baseline prescribing of the promoted drug [62], and when <lb/>physicians had larger prescribing volumes overall [67]. Longer <lb/>pharmaceutical sales representative visits to physicians and <lb/>residents were also more likely to be associated with increased <lb/>prescribing [69,73]. More frequent pharmaceutical sales repre-<lb/>sentative visits were associated with diminishing returns <lb/>[46,50,69]. <lb/>In addition to increasing the promoted drug&apos;s market share, <lb/>pharmaceutical sales representative visits were associated with a <lb/>decrease in the market share of competitor products [78]. <lb/>Pharmaceutical sales representative visits were more likely to be <lb/>associated with more frequent prescriptions for drugs judged more <lb/>effective and also for drugs with more side effects [40]. However <lb/>the authors of that study did not attempt to measure whether <lb/>higher levels of use represented a change in prescribing quality. <lb/>Another study found that pharmaceutical sales representative visits <lb/>were associated with a greater increase in market share for new <lb/>entrants into a therapeutic field than was positive scientific <lb/>information [49]. <lb/>Journal advertisements. Four out of the eight studies <lb/>measuring the effects of journal advertisements presented data <lb/>but did not include statistical tests [25,34,70,80]. One of these <lb/>noted use of a medication class increased after pharmaceutical <lb/>advertising commenced in a country where the medication class <lb/>was previously available but was not promoted [25]. One study <lb/>visually compared graphs of the monthly number of <lb/>advertisements and prescriptions for a group of nine drugs and <lb/>found no clear relationship between the extent of the advertising of <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>a drug and the amount of prescribing by general practitioners <lb/>[70]. One study found that the market share of a medication was <lb/>higher amongst physicians who recognised the advertisement for <lb/>that medication compared to those who did not [80]. The last <lb/>study observed decreased prescribing of two drug classes at the <lb/>same time that advertising decreased [34]. <lb/>Of the four studies that included statistical tests, one found <lb/>that journal advertisements have a more pronounced effect on <lb/>market share for the advertised drug than does positive <lb/>scientific information published in medical journals [49]. A <lb/>cross-sectional study found contradictory results. Self-reported <lb/>infrequent use of journal advertisements by physicians to learn <lb/>about new medications was not associated with frequency of <lb/>prescribing. However, infrequent use of journal advertisements <lb/>was associated with less chloramphenicol prescribing [77]. <lb/>One cross-sectional study found that physicians who recalled <lb/>advertisements became prescribers of the advertised products <lb/>in consistently larger proportions than those who did not recall <lb/>advertisements [75]. Another study found that 9% of high <lb/>prescribers of new drugs cited advertisements as an influence <lb/>on their prescribing compared to 0% for low prescribers; <lb/>however, this was not a statistically significant association <lb/>[67]. <lb/>Attendance at pharmaceutical company-sponsored meet-<lb/>ings.

			<body>Mailed <lb/>information <lb/>from <lb/>pharmaceutical <lb/>com-<lb/>panies. One of the three studies of mailed promotional ma-<lb/>terial found an association with increased prescribing [76]. The <lb/>others found no association [33,67]. <lb/>Advertising in clinical software. A single study examined <lb/>the effect of advertising in clinical practice software and found no <lb/>association with prescribing frequency for six medications and less <lb/>prescribing of one medication [29]. The overall result was no <lb/>association between advertising and prescribing frequency. <lb/>Total promotional investment. Eight studies combined the <lb/>outcome measures for various exposures to pharmaceutical <lb/>company information or measured overall promotional invest-<lb/>ment, a proxy for the amount of exposure to information from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies. Three studies found that total pro-<lb/>motional investment was positively associated with prescribing <lb/>frequency [30,33,51]. Two studies found both positive results and <lb/>no association [53,54]. One study did not detect an association <lb/>[52]. <lb/>Meta-analysis of promotional information and prescrib-<lb/>ing frequency. We pooled results from a total of seven studies <lb/>using a random effects model to examine whether exposure to <lb/>promotion was associated with prescribing of the promoted <lb/>medication. The seven study results included in the meta-<lb/>analysis showed significant heterogeneity (I <lb/>2 = 91% [95% <lb/>confidence interval (CI) 84%–95%], tau <lb/>2 = 0.35), and therefore <lb/>we have presented the forest plot without the pooled outcome <lb/>(Figure 2) [29,30,31,38,39,63,75]. Using sensitivity analysis we <lb/>found that study design, quality factors, year of publication, and <lb/>type of physician did not explain this heterogeneity. One study <lb/>provided two units of analysis with outcomes amenable to meta-<lb/>analysis: a significant association for attendance at sponsored <lb/>meetings and a nonsignificant result for pharmaceutical sales <lb/>representative (PSR) visits [31]. We included only that <lb/>nonsignificant result in the forest plot (Figure 2). When meta-<lb/>analysis was conducted using the significantly positive result for <lb/>attendance at a pharmaceutical company-sponsored meeting, the <lb/>summary result and level of heterogeneity did not differ greatly. <lb/>The largest difference detected was between exposure to active <lb/>promotional information (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.50–3.65), <lb/>(I <lb/>2 = 59%, 95% CI 0%–86%, tau squared = 0.11) [31,38,39,63] <lb/>and passive promotional information (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.72– <lb/>2.15) (I <lb/>2 = 89.5%, tau squared = 0.14) [29,75]. <lb/>Information Delivered Without Conventional Promotion <lb/>Techniques <lb/>Five studies looked for associations between information <lb/>delivered without conventional promotion techniques and the <lb/>frequency of physicians&apos; prescribing [35,36,37,58,59].

Neither found an association with <lb/>physicians&apos; prescribing. A single controlled-cohort study of a <lb/>pharmaceutical company-funded randomized controlled trial found <lb/>that physicians&apos; participation in recruiting subjects was associated <lb/>with an increase in the number of prescriptions of the sponsoring <lb/>company&apos;s drug [37]. One time-series analysis found no change in <lb/>the rate of decline in the prescribing of a medication when the main <lb/>manufacturer was required by a regulatory agency to deliver an <lb/>educational program warning about problems with the drug via <lb/>mailed information and pharmaceutical sales representative visits <lb/>[58]. A cross-sectional study found no change in prescription rates <lb/>following warning letters regarding drug side effects [59]. <lb/>Pharmaceutical Company Information and Prescribing <lb/>Costs <lb/>Eight studies (Table 9) [35,41,50,55,66,68,69,71] measured <lb/>prescribing costs as costs per physician, price elasticity, and <lb/>changes in generic prescribing (ten units of analysis). In the United <lb/>States, one econometric time-series analysis found that pharma-<lb/>ceutical sales representative visits were associated with increased <lb/>price sensitivity among physicians prescribing in one therapeutic <lb/>class [69], and another found the opposite effect for hypertension <lb/>[50].

			<body>tative visits, journal advertisements, and direct mail) was associated <lb/>with reduced price sensitivity for primary care providers and <lb/>psychiatrists in 11 therapeutic classes consisting of more than 50% <lb/>of the Dutch drug market [41]. Of three cross-sectional studies, <lb/>two detected an association between pharmaceutical sales <lb/>representative visits and higher prescribing costs [66,71], but one <lb/>did not detect an association [68]. One study also found that low <lb/>cost prescribers were more likely to have rarely or never read <lb/>promotional mail or journal advertisements from pharmaceutical <lb/>companies than high cost prescribers [66]. One time-series <lb/>analysis found that reduced exposure to pharmaceutical sales <lb/>representative visits and promotional material was associated with <lb/>an increase in generic prescribing [55]. A randomized controlled <lb/>trial of pharmaceutical sales representative visits in a noncom-<lb/>mercial partnership between a pharmaceutical company and a <lb/>local health authority measured physicians&apos; prescribing costs for <lb/>the target drug class and found no effect [35]. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Overview <lb/>We found that the reported relationship between exposure to <lb/>information provided directly by pharmaceutical companies and <lb/>the quality, frequency, and cost of prescribing varied from case to <lb/>case. However, with only one exception [39], the included studies <lb/>reported that exposure to information from pharmaceutical <lb/>companies was associated with either lower prescribing quality <lb/>or no association was detected. Similarly, exposure to information <lb/>from pharmaceutical companies was associated with either an <lb/>increase in prescribing frequency or no association was detected. <lb/>Three studies found that exposure was associated with increased <lb/>drug sales up to a point of diminishing returns beyond which more <lb/>promotion was increasingly less effective [46,50,69]. Finally, with <lb/>only one exception [69], exposure to information from pharma-<lb/>ceutical companies was associated with an increase in prescribing <lb/>costs or no association was detected. <lb/>This review has supported, updated, and extended the findings <lb/>of previous reviews regarding the effects of exposure to <lb/>information from pharmaceutical companies. 38 of the 58 <lb/>included studies (66%) were not included in previous systematic <lb/>reviews on this topic [25,29–32,34,35,40–42,44,48,49,51–59,61– <lb/>68,70,72,75,76,78–82], including seven of the ten studies of <lb/>prescribing quality [37,58,59,61,64,81,82] and four of the seven <lb/>studies of prescribing costs [35,55,66,68]. <lb/>Most of the included studies measured the frequency of <lb/>prescribing. Amongst these, the studies of informational exposure <lb/>where physicians are active participants, such as representatives&apos; <lb/>visits, sponsored meetings, or sponsored trials, more consistently <lb/>found associations with higher prescribing frequency than studies <lb/>of more passive exposures, such as journal advertisements and <lb/>mailed information. Poor study quality precludes confident <lb/>conclusions about journal advertising. However, one higher <lb/>quality econometric analysis found that advertisements in journals <lb/>were associated with a more pronounced effect on market share <lb/>than positive scientific findings published in journals [49]. Also <lb/>there are claims in the marketing literature that the relatively low <lb/>cost of passive methods and their ability to synergistically increase <lb/>the effectiveness of active methods makes them cost effective <lb/>components of sales campaigns [84]. <lb/>Limitations of Included Studies <lb/>All of the included studies had design limitations (Tables 1–5). <lb/>We found only two randomized controlled trials [35,36]. Both <lb/>lacked adequate reporting of allocation concealment and blinding. <lb/>These two trials did not examine standard promotional practice <lb/>but instead assessed novel partnerships of government or academia <lb/>with industry aiming for less expensive, higher quality prescribing. <lb/>On the basis of these two negative randomized controlled trials, it <lb/>seems unlikely that similar partnerships will have beneficial effects <lb/>on prescribing. No definite conclusions can be extrapolated from <lb/>these studies to standard promotional practice. <lb/>All other included studies were observational and thus able to <lb/>measure associations but not prove causation. There is a risk that <lb/>reported associations may be false positives, and that statistically <lb/>significant findings may not necessarily be clinically significant. <lb/>One example is the study by Mizik et al. that reports only a small <lb/>Study Design <lb/>Study (First <lb/>Author Name) <lb/>Study Site, <lb/>Year <lb/>Participants (n) <lb/>Medication <lb/>Intervention/Exposure <lb/>Outcome Measure(s) <lb/>Haayer [74] <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>1979 <lb/>PCPs (116) <lb/>Medications that <lb/>would result from 8 <lb/>case-histories devised <lb/>by a panel <lb/>PSR visits; Journal <lb/>advertisements; <lb/>Companies&apos; mailings <lb/>Prescribing rationality <lb/>based on a composite <lb/>scale (drug choice, <lb/>duration, dose and use of <lb/>combination products) <lb/>Walton [75] <lb/>US 1976–77 <lb/>PCPs (29%) <lb/>and specialists <lb/>(71%) (1,000 total) <lb/>186 different <lb/>medications <lb/>Journal advertisements <lb/>Prescriptions of advertised <lb/>drugs (intention to <lb/>prescribe) <lb/>Dajda [76] <lb/>UK 1975 <lb/>PCPs in UK <lb/>d <lb/>Branded advertised <lb/>drugs in the UK <lb/>Mailed advertisements <lb/>(number in 1 y) <lb/>n prescriptions <lb/>Becker [77] <lb/>US 1970 <lb/>PCPs (29), internists <lb/>(3). osteopathic <lb/>physicians (5) <lb/>Chloramphenicol, <lb/>equagesic, vitamin <lb/>B12, methylphenidate, <lb/>oral contraceptives <lb/>Use of journal <lb/>advertisements <lb/>PSR visits (frequency) <lb/>Proportion of <lb/>chloramphenicol scripts. <lb/>Physicians&apos; self-reported <lb/>prescribing behaviour. <lb/>a <lb/>Experimental partnerships between pharmaceutical company and health authority or academic department. <lb/>b Data from pharmaceutical company. <lb/>c <lb/>Information from a market research company. <lb/>d Total number unknown. <lb/>e <lb/>Using national prescribing data. <lb/>PCP, primary care provider; RCT, randomized controlled trial. <lb/>doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1000352.t006 <lb/>Table 6.

			<body>increase in prescriptions associated with visits from pharmaceutical <lb/>sales representatives [45]. Associations may also arise from <lb/>confounding, bias, or chance. False negatives or inaccurate <lb/>estimation of effect sizes may result from small sample sizes, <lb/>measurement errors, overly complex models, or &apos;&apos;contamination&apos;&apos; <lb/>when prescribers who are thought to be unexposed are actually <lb/>influenced by other methods. For example in a study of <lb/>promotional meetings, nonattenders may be influenced by sales <lb/>representatives thus reducing the difference from attenders in their <lb/>prescribing. Another possible source of contamination is indirect <lb/>influence by colleagues who have been influenced directly. <lb/>To the extent that the measured associations are real, causality <lb/>may be bidirectional. The influence of information from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies on prescribing is a likely explanation <lb/>for the associations given that the major purpose of pharmaceu-<lb/>tical promotion is to influence prescribing [3]. However, it is also <lb/>possible that physicians who prescribe larger quantities, more <lb/>expensively or less appropriately may allow themselves to be <lb/>exposed to, or attract, more promotional information. <lb/>Some studies found no association between exposure to <lb/>information from pharmaceutical companies and prescribing <lb/>outcomes or small effect sizes that seem unlikely to be clinically <lb/>significant. Some of these may be false negatives or underestima-<lb/>tions caused by study flaws, but it is likely that information from <lb/>companies sometimes has little or no effect, especially when the <lb/>information is not designed to increase sales, e.g., letters warning <lb/>about safety problems. Most of the studies included in this review <lb/>examined single components of promotional campaigns that may <lb/>have little or no effect alone but have a synergistic effect in <lb/>combination with other components. Promotion may be less <lb/>effective if it is used beyond the point of diminishing returns or is <lb/>up against similarly effective promotion for another similar product. <lb/>Exposure to Information <lb/>from Drug Company <lb/>Study (First <lb/>Author Name) <lb/>Results <lb/>Change in Prescribing Frequency <lb/>Results <lb/>Freemantle [35] <lb/>PSR visits were not associated with an increase in the <lb/>prescription of the detailed medication <lb/>OR = 1.04 (95% CI 0.83–1.31); p = 0.73 <lb/>Dolovich [36] <lb/>PSR visits were not associated with a change in the market <lb/>share of amoxicillin <lb/>Intervention group: +0.63% market <lb/>share, control group: 20.72% market <lb/>share; p = 0.15 <lb/>Kazmierczak [59] <lb/>Mailed warning letters regarding tramadol for those with a <lb/>seizure risk were not associated with a change in prescription <lb/>rates for tramadol <lb/>a <lb/>Before mailing: 10% prescribing rate, <lb/>after mailing 9% prescribing rate. <lb/>Soumerai [58] <lb/>PSR visits: Propoxyphene use continued a preexisting decline <lb/>of about 8% a year during the time when warnings from the <lb/>manufacturing pharmaceutical company were expressed by <lb/>PSRs after which time this decline halted, however a statistical <lb/>association was not shown.

			<body>Given the controversial nature of this topic, there are many <lb/>reasons why the studies could be biased overall in either direction. <lb/>Authors may have produced results consistent with their <lb/>ideological bias. Also reciprocal obligation to funders who <lb/>preferred certain results may have lead to bias with or without <lb/>conscious awareness. Publication and outcome reporting bias may <lb/>have led to underrepresentation of negative, positive, uninterest-<lb/>ing, or unwanted findings. <lb/>Strengths and Weaknesses <lb/>The strengths of this review include use of a comprehensive <lb/>search strategy over multiple databases without any language <lb/>exclusions. We consulted widely with experts in the field and we <lb/>used validated instruments to assess quality of the studies. <lb/>However, only one of the included studies was conducted in a <lb/>low-income economy, as defined by the World Bank, so the effects <lb/>of promotion there are less certain [33]. This study found a <lb/>positive association between pharmaceutical promotion and <lb/>prescribing frequency. Promotion may be more influential in <lb/>these countries given the relative paucity of independent sources of <lb/>information [85,86]. <lb/>Our efforts to access data that was not in the databases we <lb/>searched had mixed results. Messages on e-mail discussion groups <lb/>and contact with experts yielded five additional studies subsequent <lb/>to the initial search [34,43,80–82] whose results were consistent <lb/>with the entire review. By contrast, pharmaceutical companies did <lb/>not provide us with any information that was not already in the <lb/>public domain. However five studies included in this review <lb/>analyzed confidential data from pharmaceutical companies and <lb/>their results were also consistent with the review as a whole <lb/>[33,35,37,40,46]. <lb/>Given the wide range of knowledge and experience among the <lb/>sources that we consulted and the expertise in our group, we are <lb/>confident that we exhausted all reasonable avenues in our attempt <lb/>to obtain additional literature. <lb/>Data Interpretation <lb/>Of the 58 studies included in this review, 38 studies reported a <lb/>single unit of analysis with 25 (66%) finding significant <lb/>associations between exposure to information from pharmaceu-<lb/>tical companies and the quality, frequency, and cost of pre-<lb/>scribing and eight (21%) finding no associations. The remaining <lb/>five (13%) had multiple measures and found significant associa-<lb/>tions on some measures but not on others. The 20 studies with <lb/>more than one unit of analysis reported 49 units of analysis of <lb/>which 21 (43%) found significant associations, 24 (49%) found no <lb/>associations, and four (8%) found mixed results. The difference <lb/>between the results of the single versus multiple unit of analysis <lb/>studies is significant (p,0.05 Freeman-Halton extension of the <lb/>Fisher exact test). This difference may have been caused by <lb/>publication bias against publication of single unit of analysis <lb/>studies when no association was found. We believe the pattern of <lb/>results suggests that there was little or no reporting bias for the <lb/>multiple unit of analysis studies. Because the multiple unit of <lb/>analysis studies found no association more often than the single <lb/>unit of analysis studies, multiple mentions of the former studies in <lb/>our narrative synthesis will not exaggerate the frequency of <lb/>findings of significant associations. <lb/>Table 9.

			<body>Interpretation of our meta-analysis requires caution because <lb/>many studies included in the narrative synthesis could not be <lb/>included in the meta-analysis. Where a sufficient number of studies <lb/>could be combined, there was significant heterogeneity. The <lb/>summary result has not been presented because it is unlikely to <lb/>accurately reflect the true effect size of most promotional <lb/>campaigns for two main reasons. First, effect sizes varied widely <lb/>so it is likely that promotional campaigns often have effect sizes far <lb/>from average. Second, single promotional techniques are likely to <lb/>be less effective individually than campaigns employing multiple <lb/>promotional methods. <lb/>A sensitivity analysis found the difference between passive and <lb/>active promotion is one possible cause of heterogeneity. Other <lb/>possible explanations for variation in the effectiveness of <lb/>promotion include variation from campaign to campaign in the <lb/>relative benefits of the drug being promoted, the promoter&apos;s skills <lb/>and budget, and the target group&apos;s level of resistance to <lb/>promotion. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>The limitations of studies reported in the literature mentioned <lb/>above mean that we are unable to reach any definitive conclusions <lb/>about the degree to which information from pharmaceutical <lb/>companies increases, decreases, or has no effect on the frequency, <lb/>cost, or quality of prescribing. In theory, advertising may be <lb/>beneficial in several ways: by distributing information and thus <lb/>improving the quality of prescribing [20,78], by reducing costs <lb/>through increasing price-elasticity [69], by increasing prescribing <lb/>of drugs that provide better health outcomes, or by improving the <lb/>cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Because of the <lb/>limitations of both the included studies and this review we have <lb/>not disproved those theories but we have found little evidence to <lb/>support them and have found some evidence of increased costs <lb/>and decreased quality of prescribing. Any conclusions about harm <lb/>or benefit for patients are speculative because none of the studies <lb/>that we found examined clinical outcomes. One clear conclusion <lb/>from this review is that we did not find evidence of net <lb/>improvements in prescribing associated with exposure to infor-<lb/>mation from pharmaceutical companies. <lb/>Some argue that prescribers have an ethical duty to avoid <lb/>exposure to pharmaceutical promotion [13,87–89]. Even ineffec-<lb/>tive promotional information may be harmful if it wastes <lb/>prescribers&apos; time or if the money spent on promotion increases <lb/>the cost of medicines [90]; this is of concern given the large <lb/>expenditure involved [1,2]. In the absence of evidence of net <lb/>improvement in prescribing from exposure to promotional <lb/>information, we recommend that practitioners follow the precau-<lb/>tionary principle and thus avoid exposure to information from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies unless evidence of net benefit emerges. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Editors&apos; Summary <lb/>Background. A prescription drug is a medication that can <lb/>be supplied only with a written instruction (&apos;&apos;prescription&apos;&apos;) <lb/>from a physician or other licensed healthcare professional. In <lb/>2009, 3.9 billion drug prescriptions were dispensed in the US <lb/>alone and US pharmaceutical companies made US$300 <lb/>billion in sales revenue. Every year, a large proportion of <lb/>this revenue is spent on drug promotion. In 2004, for <lb/>example, a quarter of US drug revenue was spent on <lb/>pharmaceutical promotion. The pharmaceutical industry <lb/>claims that drug promotion—visits from pharmaceutical <lb/>sales representatives, advertisements in journals and <lb/>prescribing software, sponsorship of meetings, mailed <lb/>information—helps to inform and educate healthcare <lb/>professionals about the risks and benefits of their products <lb/>and thereby ensures that patients receive the best possible <lb/>care. Physicians, however, hold a wide range of views about <lb/>pharmaceutical promotion. Some see it as a useful and <lb/>convenient source of information. Others deny that they are <lb/>influenced by pharmaceutical company promotion but claim <lb/>that it influences other physicians. Meanwhile, several <lb/>professional organizations have called for tighter control of <lb/>promotional activities because of fears that pharmaceutical <lb/>promotion might encourage physicians to prescribe <lb/>inappropriate or needlessly expensive drugs. <lb/>Why Was This Study Done? But is there any evidence that <lb/>pharmaceutical promotion adversely influences prescribing? <lb/>Reviews of the research literature undertaken in 2000 and <lb/>2005 provide some evidence that drug promotion influences <lb/>prescribing behavior. However, these reviews only partly <lb/>assessed the relationship between information from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies and prescribing costs and <lb/>quality and are now out of date. In this study, therefore, <lb/>the researchers undertake a systematic review (a study that <lb/>uses predefined criteria to identify all the research on a given <lb/>topic) to reexamine the relationship between exposure to <lb/>information from pharmaceutical companies and the quality, <lb/>quantity, and cost of physicians&apos; prescribing. <lb/>What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers <lb/>searched the literature for studies of licensed physicians who <lb/>were exposed to promotional and other information from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies. They identified 58 studies that <lb/>included a measure of exposure to any type of information <lb/>directly provided by pharmaceutical companies and a <lb/>measure of physicians&apos; prescribing behavior. They then <lb/>undertook a &apos;&apos;narrative synthesis,&apos;&apos; a descriptive analysis of <lb/>the data in these studies. Ten of the studies, they report, <lb/>examined the relationship between exposure to phar-<lb/>maceutical company information and prescribing quality <lb/>(as judged, for example, by physician drug choices in <lb/>response to clinical vignettes). All but one of these studies <lb/>suggested that exposure to drug company information was <lb/>associated with lower prescribing quality or no association <lb/>was detected. In the 51 studies that examined the relation-<lb/>ship between exposure to drug company information and <lb/>prescribing frequency, exposure to information was <lb/>associated with more frequent prescribing or no <lb/>association was detected. Thus, for example, 17 out of 29 <lb/>studies of the effect of pharmaceutical sales representatives&apos; <lb/>visits found an association between visits and increased <lb/>prescribing; none found an association with less frequent <lb/>prescribing. Finally, eight studies examined the relationship <lb/>between exposure to pharmaceutical company information <lb/>and prescribing costs. With one exception, these studies <lb/>indicated that exposure to information was associated with a <lb/>higher cost of prescribing or no association was detected. So, <lb/>for example, one study found that physicians with low <lb/>prescribing costs were more likely to have rarely or never <lb/>read promotional mail or journal advertisements from <lb/>pharmaceutical companies than physicians with high <lb/>prescribing costs. <lb/>What Do These Findings Mean? With rare exceptions, <lb/>these findings suggest that exposure to pharmaceutical <lb/>company information is associated with either no effect on <lb/>physicians&apos; prescribing behavior or with adverse affects <lb/>(reduced quality, increased frequency, or increased costs). <lb/>Because most of the studies included in the review were <lb/>observational studies—the physicians in the studies were <lb/>not randomly selected to receive or not receive drug <lb/>company information—it is not possible to conclude that <lb/>exposure to information actually causes any changes in <lb/>physician behavior. Furthermore, although these findings <lb/>provide no evidence for any net improvement in prescribing <lb/>after exposure to pharmaceutical company information, the <lb/>researchers note that it would be wrong to conclude that <lb/>improvements do not sometimes happen. The findings <lb/>support the case for reforms to reduce negative influence to <lb/>prescribing from pharmaceutical promotion. <lb/>Additional Information.
