Some older <lb/>adults may use free drug samples or industry-spon-<lb/>sored patient assistance programs (PAP) in hopes of <lb/>lowering out-of-pocket costs, although the long-term <lb/>effect of these programs on drug spending is unclear. <lb/>OBJECTIVE: To examine older adults&apos; use of industry-<lb/>sponsored strategies to reduce out-of-pocket drug <lb/>costs and the association between doctor–patient <lb/>communication and use of these programs. <lb/>DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a 2006 nationally <lb/>representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries. <lb/>PARTICIPANTS: 14,322 community-dwelling Medi-<lb/>care beneficiaries age ≥65. <lb/>MAIN MEASURES: We conducted bivariate and multi-<lb/>variate analyses of the association between receipt of <lb/>free samples and participation in PAPs with socio-<lb/>demographic characteristics, health status, access to <lb/>care, drug coverage, medication cost burden, and <lb/>doctor–patient communication. <lb/>KEY RESULTS: 51.4% of seniors reported receiving at <lb/>least one free sample over the last 12 months and <lb/>29.2% reported receiving free samples more than once. <lb/>In contrast, only 1.3% of seniors reported participating <lb/>in an industry-sponsored PAP. Higher income respon-<lb/>dents were more likely to report free sample receipt <lb/>than low-income respondents (50.8% vs. 43.8%, p&lt; <lb/>0.001) and less likely to report participating in a PAP <lb/>(0.42% vs. 2.2%, p&lt;0.001). In multivariate analyses, <lb/>those who reported talking to their doctor about the <lb/>cost of their medications had more than twice the odds <lb/>of receiving samples as those who did not (OR 2.17, <lb/>95% CI 1.95–2.42). <lb/>CONCLUSIONS: In 2006, over half of seniors in <lb/>Medicare received free samples, but only 1.3% <lb/>reported receiving any medications from a patient <lb/>assistance program. Doctor–patient communication is <lb/>strongly associated with use of these programs, which <lb/>has important implications for clinical care regardless <lb/>of whether these programs are viewed as drivers of <lb/>prescription costs or a remedy for them. <lb/> KEY WORDS: free drug samples; prescription assistance programs; <lb/>Medicare; physician–patient communication. <lb/>J Gen Intern Med 26(12):1458–64 <lb/>DOI: 10.1007/s11606-011-1801-y <lb/>© Society of General Internal Medicine 2011 <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Many seniors have difficulty paying for their medications <lb/>and may respond by skipping doses of their medications or <lb/>failing to fill prescriptions. <lb/>1–5 Such cost-related non-adher-<lb/>ence persists even after the expansion in drug coverage <lb/>brought about by Medicare Part D, because of coverage gaps <lb/>in the Part D benefit. <lb/>6–9 Seniors&apos; strategies to lower out-of-<lb/>pocket costs may include use of free samples from the <lb/>pharmaceutical industry and enrollment in pharmaceutical <lb/>industry-sponsored patient assistance programs (PAP), <lb/>which provide certain medications at low or no cost. The <lb/>extent to which Medicare beneficiaries have used these two <lb/>strategies after Part D&apos;s implementation is unknown. <lb/>While free samples may help to alleviate some of the <lb/>financial burden associated with drug costs for low-income <lb/>patients, evidence suggests that samples are not always <lb/>targeted to those who could most benefit from them <lb/>10–13 , <lb/>and their use may be associated with an increase in out-of-<lb/>pocket drug costs. <lb/>14 Much less is known about seniors&apos; <lb/>participation in PAPs and very little data exist on the use of <lb/>these programs. <lb/>15–20 In a telephone survey of PAPs, only 4% <lb/>of programs would state how many people they had helped, <lb/>which ranged from single digits to over 10,000. <lb/>19,20 <lb/>Physicians report provision of free samples as one of their <lb/>most frequently used strategies for reducing patients&apos; out-of-<lb/>pocket costs. <lb/>21 Medicare beneficiaries, however, seldom <lb/>discuss these costs with their physicians. <lb/>22 We know little <lb/>about how doctor–patient communication about drug costs <lb/>may be associated with the use of free samples or participa-<lb/>tion in PAPs. Understanding this association may shed light <lb/>on whether physicians are targeting the programs to patients <lb/>they think are most likely to benefit. Our goal for this study is <lb/>to provide nationally representative data on seniors&apos; use of <lb/></body>

			<body>free samples and patient assistance programs, to describe the <lb/>characteristics of users of these programs, and to examine <lb/>the association between doctor–patient communication and <lb/>participation in these programs. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Study Design and Sample <lb/>We used data from a 2006 survey of 16,072 community-<lb/>dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, adminis-<lb/>tered in English and Spanish between October and Decem-<lb/>ber 2006. Respondents included individuals who <lb/>responded to a 2003 national survey of Medicare benefi-<lb/>ciaries <lb/>4 , plus an additional random sample of beneficiaries <lb/>newly enrolled in Medicare since 2003. The survey used a <lb/>mail-and telephone-based system and administered vali-<lb/>dated questions on sociodemographics, health character-<lb/>istics, drug coverage, medication use, out-of-pocket <lb/>spending and cost-related nonadherence. A more detailed <lb/>description of the survey instrument and sampling frame is <lb/>available elsewhere. <lb/>1,23 <lb/>After accounting for beneficiaries excluded because of death, <lb/>institutionalization, non-English/Spanish language, and severe <lb/>cognitive impairment, the response rate was 56 percent. Non-<lb/>respondents were slightly older with less education and poorer <lb/>health, and disproportionately of minority race/ethnicity. <lb/>1 For <lb/>this analysis, we included individuals who reported taking at <lb/>least one prescription medicine over the past year (n=14,322). <lb/>Free Samples and Patient Assistance Programs <lb/>The survey included two questions specifically asking about <lb/>receipt of free samples and participation in PAPs: 1) during <lb/>the last 12 months, have any of your doctors given you free <lb/>samples of prescription medicine? (Yes, more than once; Yes, <lb/>one time; No); 2) do you currently get some of your <lb/>prescription medicines through a patient assistance pro-<lb/>gram run by a company that makes the medicines? <lb/>Although we report the crude percentages of free sample <lb/>receipt as a three-category variable, for the purposes of the <lb/>bivariate and multivariate analyses we dichotomized sample <lb/>receipt (yes/no). <lb/>Doctor–Patient Communication <lb/>The survey included several questions soliciting experiences <lb/>with and beliefs about the doctor–patient relationship and <lb/>communication. These included questions on respondent <lb/>attitudes about the doctor&apos;s role in lowering drug costs (e.g., <lb/>how willing would they be to talk about costs with their <lb/>doctors) and on behaviors and communication with doctors <lb/>about drug costs (e.g. did they talk to their providers about <lb/>drug costs and their medications; did they let their doctor <lb/>know that they did not fill a prescription because of cost (cost-<lb/>related nonadherence)). These validated items have been used <lb/>in prior analyses of doctor–patient communication. <lb/>22 <lb/>Covariates <lb/>Covariates included age (65–74, 75–84, 85+), gender, race/ <lb/>ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other), residence in a rural <lb/>state, the number of self-reported chronic conditions (including <lb/>hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, <lb/>asthma or COPD, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthri-<lb/>tis, cancer, and depression), number of medications (1–2, 3–4, or <lb/>more than 5), education (less than high school, high school, some <lb/>college, and college graduate), and monthly income categories <lb/>based on the 2006 federal poverty line (≤$800, $801–2000, <lb/>$2001–2500, &gt;$2500). For approximately 12% of respondents <lb/>with missing income data, income was imputed based on Buck&apos;s <lb/>Method <lb/>24 <lb/>, which uses ordinal logistic regression to estimate the <lb/>predicted probabilities of the missing income data and replaces <lb/>missing values with values having the highest probability among <lb/>the income categories; this method puts respondents into the <lb/>single most likely category, which has an advantage of ease of <lb/>understanding over other imputation methods that may classify <lb/>respondents into multiple categories based on a probability <lb/>distribution. An alternative specification using a dummy variable <lb/>for missing income yielded similar results; thus we report the <lb/>results using imputed income. <lb/>We included an indicator for primary source of prescription drug <lb/>coverage: (stand alone Part D Prescription Drug Plan (PDP), <lb/>Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plan (MAPD), employer-<lb/>sponsored plans (including Tricare), Veterans Affairs (VA), Other). <lb/>Those indicating more than one source of coverage were assigned to <lb/>a primary source based on this hierarchy. An alternative specifica-<lb/>tion using a dummy variable for those with multiple sources of <lb/>coverage yielded results that were qualitatively similar to the main <lb/>analysis; thus we report the results using this hierarchy. <lb/>Finally, we included several self-reported indicators of health <lb/>status and access to care: self-reported fair or poor health, having <lb/>a regular doctor, any hospitalization in prior year, and number of <lb/>visits to &quot; your personal doctor &quot; over the past year. <lb/>Analysis <lb/>We conducted bivariate analyses of the association of socio-<lb/>demographic characteristics, health status, access to care, <lb/>and doctor–patient communication factors with receipt of <lb/>free samples and participation in PAPs using chi-square <lb/>tests. We used multivariate logistic regression analyses to <lb/>examine the independent association between free sample <lb/>use and sociodemographic, health status, and access to care <lb/>variables. Because many of the doctor–patient communica-<lb/>tion variables were highly correlated, we included one <lb/>measure—whether the respondent had discussed medica-<lb/>tion costs with the doctor in the previous year—in the <lb/>multivariate analysis. Participation in PAPs was too low to <lb/>warrant multivariate analyses. Probability sampling weights <lb/>were applied to all analyses to correct for unequal sampling <lb/>probabilities across states and strata. All p values are two-<lb/></body>

The <lb/>respondents were predominately white (86%) and had 2 or <lb/>more chronic conditions (71%). Almost half reported using five <lb/>or more medications. Nearly all reported having a regular <lb/>doctor (95%) whom they visited at least once in the past <lb/>12 months (98%). <lb/>Sample Receipt <lb/>Overall, 51.4% of seniors reported receiving at least one free <lb/>sample over the last 12 months and 29.2% reported receiving <lb/>free samples more than once. Higher income respondents were <lb/>more likely to report free sample receipt than their lowest <lb/>income counterparts (50.8% with monthly income &gt;$2500 vs. <lb/>43.8% with incomes ≤$800) (Table 2). Whites were more likely <lb/>to report free sample receipt than black and Hispanic respon-<lb/>dents (52.3%, 46.3%, and 45.1%, respectively) (all p&lt;0.001). <lb/>Free sample receipt varied significantly by source of drug <lb/>coverage; only 38% of respondents with VA insurance reported <lb/>free sample receipt, compared to 50.8% of those with employer <lb/>insurance, 45.5% of those in MAPD plans, and 55.6% of those <lb/>in PDPs. Seniors with a regular doctor were more likely to <lb/>report receiving free samples (52.1% vs. 37.4%, p&lt;0.001). <lb/>Seniors who talked about the cost of their medications with <lb/>their doctor were significantly more likely to receive samples <lb/>than those who did not (67.6% vs. 44.4%, p&lt;0.001) (Table 3). <lb/>Patients who expressed a willingness to talk to their doctor if <lb/>they had a problem affording their medication were signifi-<lb/>cantly more likely to receive free samples, with 54.8% of those <lb/>saying they definitely would talk vs. 43.4% of those saying <lb/>probably not or 39.5% saying definitely not, receiving free <lb/>samples (p&lt;0.001). Likewise, seniors saying it is definitely part <lb/>of a doctor&apos;s job to ask patients about problems paying for <lb/>prescriptions were more likely to receive samples than those <lb/>saying &apos;no probably not&apos;, or &apos;no definitely not&apos; (53.7% vs. 49.3% <lb/>and 37.7% respectively, p&lt;0.001). Seniors who let their doctor <lb/>know about their cost-related non-adherence were more likely <lb/>to receive samples than those who did not (70.5% vs. 54.4%, p <lb/>&lt;0.001). <lb/>After controlling for other factors, those who talked to their <lb/>doctor about medication costs had 2.17 times the odds of <lb/>receiving samples as those who did not (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.95, <lb/>2.42) (Table 4). Blacks and Hispanics had lower odds of <lb/>reporting sample receipt (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67, 0.95 and OR <lb/>0.79, 95% CI 0.63, 1.00), as did those in the lowest income <lb/>group. Respondents from rural regions had lower odds of <lb/>sample receipt as well (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52, 0.88). <lb/>Patient Assistance Programs <lb/>Only 1.3% of seniors reported participating in a PAP run by a <lb/>pharmaceutical company. Lower income seniors were more <lb/>likely to report participation than those in the highest income <lb/>groups (2.2% vs. 0.42%, p&lt;0.001) and those lacking insurance <lb/>coverage were more likely to participate (2.7% of those without <lb/>prescription insurance vs. 0.44% of those with employer <lb/>insurance, 1.1% of those in MAPD plans, and 1.7% in PDPs <lb/>(p&lt;0.001) (Table 2). Respondents with less than a high school <lb/>education were significantly more likely to participate (2.0%) <lb/>Table 1.

Seniors reporting they <lb/>would definitely not talk to their doctor if they had problems <lb/>affording medications were less likely to use these programs <lb/>than those who definitely would talk to their doctor (0.3% vs. <lb/>1.5%, p&lt;0.001) <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This nationally representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries <lb/>indicates that use of free samples is widespread among older <lb/>adults, while participation in industry-sponsored patient <lb/>assistance programs appears extremely limited. Those with <lb/>less education, lower income and lacking a primary care <lb/>physician were less likely to receive free samples. Seniors <lb/>who expressed a willingness to and experience with discussing <lb/>medication costs with their doctors were much more likely to <lb/>receive free samples than those who did not have these <lb/>discussions. In contrast, while few seniors participated in <lb/>industry-sponsored PAPs, participation was higher among <lb/>those with low income and those lacking prescription coverage. <lb/>Two prior studies of free sample receipt in the Medicare <lb/>population reported similar rates of use, but these studies <lb/>used pre-Part D data. <lb/>25,26 In the most recent of these studies, <lb/>low-income seniors and racial/ethnic minorities in the 2004 <lb/>Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) were less likely <lb/>to ask for or receive samples, similar to our findings post Part <lb/>D. <lb/>25 We additionally found that one-third of those who had <lb/>used PAPs, who presumably have the greatest need for <lb/>financial assistance, did not report any free sample use. <lb/>The important question of whether prescription samples <lb/>and PAPs are truly helping those in need versus driving the use <lb/>of higher cost drugs warrants further study. <lb/>10,13,27 Ideally, <lb/>patients with lower income and those most in need would <lb/>receive the majority of free samples if they had a clear <lb/>indication for a brand-name drug over a generic equivalent. <lb/>The high prevalence of cost-related non-adherence among <lb/>lower income seniors <lb/>23 could be partially mitigated by use of <lb/>free samples. On the other hand, samples have the potential to <lb/>increase costs and the use of brand name drugs. <lb/>10,28–30 It is <lb/>possible, in fact, that lower income seniors are receiving fewer <lb/>samples precisely because they have higher rates of generic <lb/>drug use, and that increasing the use of samples among this <lb/>group might increase their use of more expensive medications. <lb/>Due to the controversy surrounding the provision of free <lb/>samples, there are efforts underway to limit and regulate their <lb/>distribution. <lb/>31 In a 2009 report on conflicts of interest in <lb/>medicine, the Institute of Medicine recommended that physi-<lb/>cians and training programs limit (and in some cases prohibit) <lb/>the use of free drug samples, except in situations for patients <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>with financial difficulty. <lb/>32 The Medicare Payment Advisory <lb/>Commission (MedPAC) recently recommended tracking the <lb/>distribution of free samples to physician practices by pharma-<lb/>ceutical companies. <lb/>33 It will be important to understand how <lb/>these policy changes affect the use of free samples. <lb/>Our survey is the first that directly asks a national sample of <lb/>seniors whether they receive drugs through patient assistance <lb/>programs. PAPs cover a majority of the top-selling medications <lb/>in the US <lb/>18,20 , and most of the programs base eligibility <lb/>partially on income, although income cutoffs vary, with some <lb/>as high as 750% of the federal poverty limit. <lb/>20 Slightly more <lb/>than a quarter of these programs did not require documenta-<lb/>tion of income in 2007 and about half allowed patients to have <lb/>existing prescription coverage. <lb/>20 <lb/>The industry emphasizes the important role these programs <lb/>play in helping people pay for prescription drugs <lb/>27,34 , yet our <lb/>survey finds that only 1.3% of Medicare beneficiaries report <lb/>program participation. It may be that the PAPs are geared <lb/>towards those under the age of 65, and in fact a survey of these <lb/>patient assistance programs found that only 29% provided <lb/>assistance for patients enrolled in Part D, with an additional <lb/>17% assisting Part D beneficiaries only if they are in the <lb/>coverage gap. <lb/>20 While there is some concern that these <lb/>programs may lead patients towards a brand-name product <lb/>when other less costly alternatives are available <lb/>20,35 <lb/>, the low <lb/>rate of PAP use among Medicare beneficiaries may mean this is <lb/>less of a problem. Alternatively, given the high-rate of cost-<lb/>related nonadherence observed among low-income seniors and <lb/>those lacking prescription coverage, many seniors could <lb/>potentially benefit from these programs. <lb/>Doctor–Patient Communication <lb/>Reporting discussing medication costs with one&apos;s physician <lb/>had a strong positive association with free sample receipt as <lb/>well as participation in PAPs. Seniors who talked about the <lb/>cost of their medications with their doctor were significantly <lb/>more likely than those who did not to receive samples (67.6% <lb/>vs. 44.4%, p&lt;0.001) and to use patient assistance programs <lb/>(1.9% vs. 0.9%, p&lt;0.001). While we are unable in a cross-<lb/>sectional survey to infer a causal relationship between these <lb/>behaviors, communication about drug costs was a more <lb/>important predictor of free sample receipt in multivariable <lb/>analyses than either income or drug coverage. Evidence <lb/>suggests that communication with patients about costs can <lb/>improve adherence to medication <lb/>36 , but that these conversa-<lb/>tions are still rare. <lb/>21,22,37–39 Our results reinforce this impor-<lb/>tant association between doctor–patient communication and <lb/>management of prescription costs. <lb/>There are potential differences in how doctor–patient com-<lb/>munication could affect receipt of samples and participation in <lb/>PAPs. Physician offices are the key source of prescription <lb/>samples for patients. While over 90% of PAPs required patients <lb/>in 2007 to submit prescriptions to receive assistance and <lb/>almost half delivered the medication to the doctor&apos;s office <lb/>rather than directly to the patient <lb/> 20 <lb/>, patients likely have more <lb/>flexibility to enroll in PAPs outside of the doctor&apos;s visit. <lb/>Nonetheless, the physician plays a central role in both of these <lb/>processes because they are ultimately responsible for the <lb/>prescription. Improved doctor–patient communication does <lb/>not necessarily have to lead to greater participation in these <lb/>programs; it would, however, open the door to participation for <lb/>many patients who could benefit and would encourage honest <lb/>discussions about the risks and benefits of participation in the <lb/>programs. <lb/>Limitations <lb/>The results of this study must be interpreted in the context of <lb/>the study design. First, the survey achieved a modest response <lb/>rate (56%) and did not include institutionalized Medicare <lb/>beneficiaries or those younger than age 65. Because the most <lb/>vulnerable seniors are not represented, we may underestimate <lb/>the socioeconomic disparity in free sample use. Second, we <lb/>assigned the 20% of beneficiaries reporting multiple sources of <lb/>drug coverage to one primary source using a pre-defined <lb/>hierarchy; we may have thus overlooked the effect of secondary <lb/>sources of coverage in helping patients afford prescriptions <lb/>(such as VA or employer plans). However, the distribution of <lb/>coverage sources in our sample using the hierarchical ap-<lb/>proach is similar to national data from the Department of <lb/>Health and Human Services. <lb/>40 Third, our question about <lb/>prescription assistance programs asks respondents whether <lb/>they receive any of their medications through programs <lb/>sponsored by manufacturers that make their drugs, and thus <lb/>asks about current use. As a result, our analysis may <lb/>underestimate the number of people who have ever used these <lb/>programs. Finally, the study is cross-sectional, and as such, <lb/>we cannot infer a causal relationship between doctor–patient <lb/>communication and receipt of assistance with prescription <lb/>medications. <lb/> CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In this analysis, we examine the use of two pharmaceutical <lb/>industry activities that have very different rates of take-up <lb/>among seniors. More than half of seniors use free samples, <lb/>with the highest rates among higher income seniors; patient <lb/>assistance programs, on the other hand, have very low use <lb/>but are predominately used by those most in need. Our <lb/>results reinforce the importance for physicians and other <lb/>providers of communicating with their patients about these <lb/>programs and about their patients&apos; difficulties paying for <lb/>medications, and increasing their efforts to connect those in <lb/>need with patient assistance programs, if possible. Physi-<lb/>cians and researchers must also be vigilant in monitoring <lb/>the drugs available through these programs, regardless of <lb/>whether they are viewed as drivers of prescription costs or a <lb/>remedy for them, to assure that the most cost-effective and <lb/>safe medications are used. <lb/></body>
