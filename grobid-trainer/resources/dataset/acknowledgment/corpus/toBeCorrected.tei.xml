        <acknowledgment>A100) to the three aforementioned heterodontosaurids (Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus) and 37 other ornithischian ingroups in an analysis of 221 characters. Reanalysis of 218 of these characters (3 are uninformative) confirms their result; heterodontosaurids join a basal polytomy at the base of Ornithischia in a strict consensus of the many minimum length trees. Resolution of heterodontosaurid monophyly or relationships among heterodontosaurids was possible only when Echinodon, Lycorhinus and three other poorly known ornithischians (Zephyrosaurus, Talenkauen,  Yandusaurus)  were removed from the analysis  (Fig. 103C ). With these poorly known taxa removed, there are 27 minimum length trees (468 steps) with heterodontosaurid interrelationships resembling that in  Sereno (1986) : "BMNH A100" is more closely related to Heterodontosaurus than Abrictosaurus (Butler et al. 2007: fig. 4, node 4;  Fig.  103C ). In  Sereno (1986)  and the present study, "BMNH A100" is referred to Lycorhinus angustidens, and so the proposed relationships are the same  (Figs 102, 103C) . Pisanosaurus was positioned outside all other ornithischians. The link between "BMNH A100" and Heterodontosaurus, however, is supported by two synapomorphies that have broader distribution among heterodontosaurids. Increase in size of distal premaxillary teeth (Butler et al. 2008: character 114), is present to some degree in both Echinodon  (Fig. 19B)  and Abrictosaurus (Figs 31, 35). "Heterodont dentary dentition" : character 124) is a poorly constructed character that refers in part to the presence of a dentary caniniform tooth in "BMNH A100" and Heterodontosaurus. Echinodon, Lycorhinus and Abrictosaurus were scored as lacking such "heterodonty", although from the information in this study it is clear that Echinodon (Figs 16B, C, 19B)  and Lycorhinus angustidens  (Fig. 3)  clearly have a dentary caniniform tooth and the corresponding dentary crown in Abrictosaurus  (Figs 31, 32)  is not truly primitive in form (i.e., labiolingually compressed, subtriangular).  Zheng et al. (2009)  added Tianyulong to the dataset in , which added one more genus to the heterodontosaurid polytomy. Norman et al. (2011: 59)   also used the dataset in , restricting their reanalysis to "diagnosable heterodontosaurids" and a total of 14 ingroups. Thus they excluded Fruitadens, Lycorhinus, and Tianyulong, leaving three heterodontosaurids in the analysis (Abrictosaurus, "BMNH A100", Heterodontosaurus). Like previous hypotheses  (Sereno 1986; , their resolution positioned "BMNH A100" closer to Heterodontosaurus than Abrictosaurus  (Norman et al. 2011:    fig. 41 ;  Fig. 103E ) on the basis of the weak evidence cited above.  Butler et al. (2010)  added six characters (for a total of 227) and two heterodontosaurids (Tianyulong, Fruitadens) to the previous dataset . They corrected character state scores for Echinodon and ordered a subset of the multistate characters (112, 135, 137, 138, 174). Their reanalysis yielded an unresolved basal</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Author disclosures are available with the text of this letter at www.atsjournals.org. consider. We reported no difference in daily fluid balance in the phase 2 BALTI-1 paper (7) but have no additional unpublished data from BALTI-2 (6) or BALTI-prevention (1) to help shed light on this action. However, we note that when intravenous b 2 -adrenergic agonists were used for tocolysis during pregnancy, they have been associated with reduced sodium, potassium, and water excretion, leading to a reduced hematocrit and intravascular hypervolemia  (8, 9)  and development of maternal pulmonary edema  (10) . Finally, we suggest that, although our BALTI-prevention trial did not reduce the incidence of ARDS, we did demonstrate some findings worthy of future study. We found that inhaled salmeterol resulted in a reduction in systemic inflammation, which resulted in reduced alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction perioperatively. The magnitude of the effects was not sufficient to prevent postoperative ARDS but did significantly reduce the incidence of reported postoperative pneumonia We suggest, therefore, that salmeterol protected the alveolar epithelium in patients undergoing esophagectomy by reducing inflammatory and epithelial damage during injurious one-lung ventilation. We agree with Snyder and Johnson that combination therapies, targeting different mechanisms implicated in the development of ARDS, are likely to be needed to successfully treat and prevent ARDS. n</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Step 6: Identification of the locus It is now a simple matter of verification that the conic Z with equation (12) passes through 1(0), I\, h, h an d, like any conic passing through the points of an orthocentric set, is a rectangular hyperbola. This may also be deduced from equation  (12) , by applying the test for a rectangular hyperbola on a conic in areal coordinates, as given, for example in Sommerville  [3] . The polar of X (^7 , j4^, jfj) with respect to E is x + y + z = 0, the line at infinity. X is therefore the centre of £. Since there are no terms in yz, zx, xy in equation  (12) , it follows that the triangle of reference is self-polar with respect £ and hence the circumcircle of ABC passes through X. This circumcircle is also orthogonal to the director circle of £ (Gaskin's theorem). Again I am grateful to the referee for pointing out these last two properties.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>The embracing of the Internet and associated technologies by academics is inevitable and clearly has many benefits to offer, particularly in relation to the ability to access information and to communicate with colleagues. Nevertheless, as argued in this paper, there are a number of issues associated with the use of this technology of which researchers themselves and those responsible for the encouragement and management of research should be aware. There is currently a great deal of interest, at both a theoretical and a practical Ievel, in the use of the Internet for teaching and leaming. However there is also a strong sense in which the research enterprise underpins the whole notion of a university, whether virtual or otherwise. This aspect should not be neglected in our consideration of the impact of computing and communications technology on tertiary institutions. 8.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>algorithms: one based on DAB and the other based on RAB. DAB uses tuned feature values, whereas RAB estimates class probabilities, to select features and generate likelihood images. By employing the AdaBoost framework, the proposed algorithms can enhance the independence among selected features and compose high quality likelihood images. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate and reliable tracking results than Liang's algorithm  [6] , and Collins and Liu's algorithm  [5] . Future research issues include the development and implementation of a fast learning algorithm to reduce the processing time for online tracking.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Anesthesiologists have difficulty to interpret hemodynamics of patients with ACS. Because of increased abdominal pressure, CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are falsely elevated and do not show true cardiac preload. The main limitations of OP-CABG are incomplete revascularization and intraoperative hemodynamic instability. Therefore, we suspected intraoperative surgical bleeding and right heart failure but did not consider ACS. We emphasize that all anesthesiologists and surgeons must be aware of ACS during OP-CABG, as this could be a potential complication leading to significant hemodynamic deterioration if not recognized.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Sauerland e.V. in the mid-1990s. The eclectic list of 'inspirators' listed leading <individual>German Faithlers</individual> and <individual>Asatruers Ludwig Fahrenkrog</individual>, <individual>Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson</individual>, and <individual>Géza von Neményi</individual>, together with <individual>Heimatschutz</individual> protagonist <individual>Paul SchultzeNaumburg</individual>, eco-anarchists <individual>Gustav Landauer</individual> and <individual>Paul Robien</individual>, and New Right theoreticians <individual>Alain de Benoist</individual> and <individual>Henning Eichberg</individual>. The fact that this webpage also provided a copy of the eco-terrorist Unabomber Manifesto points to the apocalyptic dimension of Kramps' philosophy as well as to his openness to violence in furthering bio-regionalist aims. As is the case with the American journal Tyr, in German Asatru contexts, bio-regionalism is most enthusiastically promoted by the circle around Tyr's German equivalent, the <individual>Heidnisches Jahrbuch</individual>. Both of its editors, <individual>Holger Kliemannel</individual> and <individual>Daniel Junker</individual>, have long been promoting bio-regionalist ideals. Further, Kliemannel collaborated with <institution>Kramps</institution> on an alternative Pagan journal, <institution>Stachelbeere (Gooseberry)</institution>, for a number of years. However, such engagements have brought to light underlying ideological differences within this network of <institution>Neopagan</institution> bio-regionalism as well. The anti-racist Neopagan network Der Steinkreis stopped distributing Die Stachelbeere once the ethno-pluralist predilections of Kramps were revealed. Furthermore, allegations of <institution>Kramps</institution>' "eco-fascism" contributed to the demise of his Arbeitskreis Bioregionalismus.  116  Aside from bio-regionalism, 'geomancy,' another related blend of Heimatschutz and völkisch racial esotericist ecologism, has caught the attention of Asatru circles gathering around the journals Tyr and Heidnisches Jahrbuch as well as the Scandinavian online journal Kulturorgan Skadinaujo.  117  In Germany,</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Here we show that stellar elemental abundance patterns for n-capture elements give us a deep insight into the star formation histories for nearby galaxies and ω Cen. Our finding is brought by two characteristics of n-capture elements; (a) the correlation of [r-process/Fe] with [Fe/H] in stellar abundances has a quite unique feature as seen in the Galactic halo stars, and (b) two distinct types of n-capture processes, i.e. r-and s-processes, occur in a different site, which yields the time difference in the contribution to the enrichment in the ISM between two processes. In addition, the [α/Fe] ratio which should represent the SN II/SN Ia ratio and thus serve as a nucleosynthesis clock as well as the s-/r-process elemental ratio is another powerful tool to infer the star formation history, though this might not be the case for dSph galaxies.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>In this paper, we have critically examined two key theories at the heart of neoclassical economics. We have identified their fundamental conceptual weaknesses and their failure in practice in the domain of public policy. We have questioned why these theories have survived, despite their conceptual weaknesses and lack of empirical validation. Our answer is that both theories have been allied to and promoted by neoliberal ideology and, in the case of GET, by the fact that there is nothing else to hold the neoclassical economic paradigm together. So, we argue, the time has come to publicly acknowledge the weaknesses of current market theories and, indeed, to recognise that they do not satisfy scientific criteria. This, in turn, provides a strong signal to neoliberal ideology that its prescriptions for public policy are not based upon sound intellectual foundations. The crisis of 2007-2008 provides a unique opportunity to re-evaluate our core theories and beliefs, and to initiate a new research agenda free of the constraints of unsatisfactory concepts such as equilibrium and market efficiency. We are, of course, not the first to call for a change in the paradigm of economics. Many authors, both before and after the crisis, have pointed to the fundamental problems of neoclassical economics and the failure of theory to represent the real world. We add our modest contribution to this line of heterodox literature. The challenge of replacing the existing paradigm is great, and can only be achieved by a persistent collective endeavour among those who do not share the assumptions and conclusions of neoclassical theory.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Glasgow, W.2. J. MENZIES CAMPBELL.    SIR,-Your correspondent <individual>Miss Mabel E. Carter</individual> (Journal,  August 7, p. 361)  asks what is the medical profession's opinion of the new craze for filling children's mouths with plates and plastic or metal contraptions in order to straighten teeth or alter the shape of the jaw. Might I as a member of the medical profession with a dental qualification be permitted to comment on her letter ? I say " comment " advisedly, as I fear she does not seek opinion but merely desires medical support to her preformed opinion so that she can thrust it down the throats of my dental colleagues. Orthodontics is no new craze. Dr. Angle, a great figure in this science like his early English colleague, <individual>Dr. Coffin</individual>, has long since departed from the scene. This work is undertaken, broadly speaking, for three reasons-namely, to improve appearance, to improve function, and to prevent the development of psychological ills. I regret that the former is-in parents' minds at least-paramount. I am sure no informed'person can fail to place this need before verse-speaking or drama. Having established, I hope beyon'd any measure of doubt, its necessity in certain cases, a word as to frequency is in order. In the past, in this country, orthodontics has been a luxury due to its cost. However, the use of stainless steel in lieu of gold, and the introduction of the National Health Service has removed to some extent the economic restriction on its universal application. However, I feel sure that</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>The statistical accuracy that can be obtained by integrating the same luminosity on target of the 2010 run is given in  Fig. 7 , which shows both the values of transversity (open points) extracted from the existing p and d data, and the corresponding error bars (closed points) estimated using the existing p data and the d data, with the projected errors of the new measurement. The gain in precision for the d-quark ranges from a factor of 2 at small x to a factor of 5 at large x, and is also important for the u-quark. If this proposal will be approved, as we hope, by CERN, the new data will provide large Q 2 results in the x-range covered by JLab12, which is very important to evaluate the size of the Q 2 evolution, and will provide lower-x data (down to x = 0.003) which are essential both to perform the integrals necessary to evaluate the tensor charges and to estimate the TMD PDFs of the sea quarks. The data will moreover remain unique until the planned Electron Ion Collider (EIC)  [38]  will be on the floor.</acknowledgment>
